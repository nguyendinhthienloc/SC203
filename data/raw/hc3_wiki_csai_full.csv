human_1,"Animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non-human animals including insect cognition. The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology. It has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology;  the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term animal intelligence are also subsumed within animal cognition.
Researchers have examined animal cognition in mammals (especially primates, cetaceans, elephants, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, raccoons and rodents), birds (including parrots, fowl, corvids and pigeons), reptiles (lizards, snakes, and turtles), fish and invertebrates (including cephalopods, spiders and insects).",0
ai_2,"Animal cognition refers to the mental capacities of non-human animals. It includes the ability to process information, perceive and attend to stimuli, learn and remember, solve problems, and make decisions. These cognitive abilities are thought to be mediated by brain functions, and research on animal cognition seeks to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying these abilities.



Studies of animal cognition have been conducted in a variety of species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. These studies have revealed that many animals are capable of sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. For example, some animals are able to use tools, communicate with others, and navigate complex environments.



Understanding animal cognition can provide insight into the evolution of cognitive abilities in humans and other animals, and can also inform the development of animal-friendly practices in fields such as animal welfare, conservation, and animal-assisted therapy.",1
human_3,"Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. High intelligence is associated with better outcomes in life.
Through intelligence, humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate. There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth, or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual's mindset and efforts. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence, are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence. They are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur, though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected.",0

It is what enables us to process, analyze, and use information, as well as to reason, plan, solve problems, and make decisions. Intelligence is a complex and multifaceted concept that is difficult to define and measure, but it is generally considered to include a range of cognitive abilities such as verbal and mathematical aptitude, spatial awareness, memory, and problem-solving skills. Intelligence is an important aspect of human behavior that is thought to be influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.",1
human_5,"The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is the first and foundational historical dictionary of the English language, published by Oxford University Press (OUP). It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.
Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was only in 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society. In 1895, the title The Oxford English Dictionary was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in 10 bound volumes. In 1933, the title The Oxford English Dictionary fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as 12 volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published, comprising 21,728 pages in 20 volumes. Since 2000, compilation of a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately half of which was complete by 2018.
The first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and by April 2014 was receiving over two million visits per month.

ai_9,"AI applications are computer systems that are designed to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, learning, and making decisions. These tasks are often referred to as ""cognitive computing"" or ""artificial intelligence"" (AI). AI applications can be classified into two broad categories: narrow or general. Narrow AI applications are designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation, whereas general AI applications are designed to perform a wide range of tasks and have the ability to learn and adapt as they encounter new situations.



Some examples of AI applications include:



Natural language processing (NLP): This involves the ability of a computer to understand and interpret human language, such as speech or text.



Machine learning: This involves the ability of a computer to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.



Robotics: This involves the use of AI to control and coordinate the movement of robots.



Computer vision: This involves the ability of a computer to recognize and interpret visual data, such as images and video.



Expert systems: This involves the use of AI to replicate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific field.



AI applications have the potential to revolutionize many industries and are being used in a variety of applications, including healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and more. However, the development and use of AI also raise ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for job displacement and the need for responsible use of the technology.",1
human_10,"A search engine is a software system designed to carry out web searches.  They search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). When a user enters a query into a search engine, the engine scans its index of web pages to find those that are relevant to the user's query. The results are then ranked by relevancy and displayed to the user. The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories and social bookmarking sites, which are maintained by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler. Any internet-based content that can't be indexed and searched by a web search engine falls under the category of deep web.",0

There are many different search engines available, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Each search engine uses its own algorithms to rank the results and determine which websites are the most relevant to your query. You can usually access a search engine by going to its website or by using a search bar that is built into your web browser.

The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called ""PageRank"". Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more.
The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1996 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan. In 2011, Google introduced ""Google Voice Search"" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. In 2012, Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature.
Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.[10] Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys.

Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles.[10][11]
Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields. 
Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016).[13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.

human_28,"Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.
The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.
The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.
Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[10] (c. 4th century BCE).[11]
Despite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1×10170,[12][a] which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, estimated to be of the order of 1080.[14]",0

Players take turns placing their stones on the intersections of the lines on the board, and the game ends when both players pass, indicating that they do not wish to make any more moves.



The game is known for its simple rules, but deep strategy and complexity. It is particularly popular in East Asia, and is played professionally in countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. Go has also gained a following in other parts of the world, and international tournaments are held regularly. The game is widely recognized for the unique challenges it presents to players and for the mental discipline and concentration it requires.",1
human_30,"The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence.
Author Pamela McCorduck writes: ""It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was a chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'."" Researcher Rodney Brooks complains: ""Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'""
""The AI effect"" is that line of thinking, the tendency to redefine AI to mean: ""AI is anything that has not been done yet."" This is the common public misperception, that as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, that solution method is no longer within the domain of AI.
McCorduck calls it an ""odd paradox"" that ""practical AI successes, computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior, were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in, and became silent partners alongside other problem-solving approaches, which left AI researchers to deal only with the 'failures', the tough nuts that couldn't yet be cracked.""

When IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue succeeded in defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, people complained that it had only used ""brute force methods"" and it wasn't real intelligence. Fred Reed writes:  Tesler's Theorem  is:
Douglas Hofstadter quotes this as do many other commentators.
When problems have not yet been formalised, they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation. The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by a human.  This formalisation is referred to as human-assisted Turing machine.[10]",0
ai_31,"The ""AI effect"" refers to the phenomenon where people underestimate the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) because they perceive it as being similar to their own thought processes and behaviors. This can lead to a tendency to attribute intelligent behavior to other factors, such as the programmer or the underlying algorithms, rather than the AI system itself.



The AI effect can lead people to overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the potential of AI systems. For example, if a person is able to perform a task with relative ease, they may assume that the task is not particularly difficult or intelligent and therefore attribute their success to their own abilities rather than recognizing the potential of the AI system that may be assisting them.



Overall, the AI effect can be a barrier to understanding and appreciating the capabilities of AI systems, and can lead to a lack of appreciation for the value that AI can bring to various fields.",1

Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs. Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.",0
ai_33,"Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows computers to recognize and process text that appears in images, such as scanned documents and digital photographs. It works by analyzing the shapes and patterns of the characters in the image and comparing them to a database of known characters. OCR software can be used to extract text from images and convert it into a digital format that can be edited and searched. OCR is commonly used in applications such as document scanning, data entry, and automatic indexing of documents. It can also be used to digitize handwritten text and to recognize text in languages that use non-Latin scripts, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic.",1
human_34,"In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.
The term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the ""American Association of Artificial Intelligence""). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky—two leading AI researchers who had survived the ""winter"" of the 1970s—warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion-dollar AI industry began to collapse.
Hype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media. Despite the rise and fall of AI's reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that ""there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day."" In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: ""Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field. Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.""
Enthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. Beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment.
Quantum winter is the prospect of a similar development in quantum computing, anticipated or contemplated by Mikhail Dyakonov, Chris Hoofnagle, Simson Garfinkel, Victor Galitsky, and Nikita Gourianov.",0
ai_35,"An ""AI winter"" refers to a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as the failure of AI technologies to meet expectations, negative public perceptions of AI, or shifts in funding priorities. During an AI winter, researchers and companies may experience difficulty obtaining funding for AI projects and there may be a general downturn in the field.



The term ""AI winter"" was coined in the 1980s, after a period of optimism and progress in the field of AI was followed by a period of setbacks and reduced funding. Since then, there have been several AI winters, in which funding and interest in the field declined, followed by periods of renewed interest and progress.



It is important to note that the term ""AI winter"" is often used metaphorically, and it is not a precise scientific term. The concept of an AI winter is used to describe periods of reduced funding and interest in the field of AI, but the severity and duration of these periods can vary.",1
human_36,"In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.
Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. 
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]
Neural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]",0
ai_37,"Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems. It is also sometimes referred to as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI).""



In symbolic AI, problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules. The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.



Symbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require logical reasoning and problem-solving, such as natural language processing, planning, and theorem proving.



However, symbolic AI systems have some limitations. They can be difficult to design and implement, and they may require a large amount of human-generated knowledge to be encoded into the system. In addition, they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input.



Today, symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations.",1
human_38,"In computer science, in particular in knowledge representation and reasoning and metalogic, the area of automated reasoning is dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science and philosophy.
The most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions).[citation needed] Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.
Other important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock's OSCAR system is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.
Tools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and calculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and many less formal ad hoc techniques.",0

There are several different approaches to automated reasoning, including rule-based systems, resolution-based systems, model-based systems, and hybrid systems that combine multiple approaches. These systems can use various logical formalisms, such as propositional logic, first-order logic, and higher-order logics, to represent and reason about knowledge.

human_44,"Machine perception is the capability of a computer system to interpret data in a manner that is similar to the way humans use their senses to relate to the world around them. The basic method that the computers take in and respond to their environment is through the attached hardware.  Until recently input was limited to a keyboard, or a mouse, but advances in technology, both in hardware and software, have allowed computers to take in sensory input in a way similar to humans.
Machine perception allows the computer to use this sensory input, as well as conventional computational means of gathering information, to gather information with greater accuracy and to present it in a way that is more comfortable for the user. These include computer vision, machine hearing, machine touch, and machine smelling, as artificial scents are, at a chemical compound, molecular, atomic level, indiscernible and identical.
The end goal of machine perception is to give machines the ability to see, feel and perceive the world as humans do and therefore for them to be able to explain in a human way why they are making their decisions, to warn us when it is failing and more importantly, the reason why it is failing.

human_58,"Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.
Reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.
Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.
In contrast to the use of ""reason"" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.
Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, ""morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.""
Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.",0

In order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible ""reasonable"" model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a finite amount of memory.",0

human_62,"In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the  Turing–Church thesis, the Church–Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:
Church, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).
On the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.
Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).",0

It states that any computation that can be performed by a human using pen and paper can also be performed by a machine, as long as it is given the right instructions.

The thesis is named after two influential figures in the history of computer science: Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. Church was a logician and mathematician who developed the concept of the ""effective calculability"" of functions, which formed the basis for the Church-Turing thesis. Turing was a computer scientist and mathematician who is widely considered to be the father of modern computer science. He developed the concept of the ""universal machine,"" which is a theoretical device that can perform any computation that is possible in principle.



The Church-Turing thesis has had a major impact on the field of computer science, and it remains an important principle in the field today. It has also sparked considerable debate and discussion among philosophers and computer scientists, as it raises a number of interesting questions about the nature of computation and the limits of what can be computed.",1
human_64,"Information theory is the scientific study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information. The field was originally established by the works of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, in the 1920s, and Claude Shannon in the 1940s.: vii  The field is at the intersection of probability theory, statistics, computer science, statistical mechanics, information engineering, and electrical engineering.
A key measure in information theory is entropy. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic security.
Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including statistical inference, cryptography, neurobiology, perception, linguistics, the evolution and function of molecular codes (bioinformatics), thermal physics, molecular dynamics, quantum computing, black holes, information retrieval, intelligence gathering, plagiarism detection,[10] pattern recognition, anomaly detection[11] and even art creation.",0
ai_65,"Information theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of the processing, transmission, and storage of information. It was developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a way to formalize the concept of information and to quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted over a given channel.



The central idea of information theory is that information can be quantified as a measure of the uncertainty of an event. For example, if you know that a coin is fair, then the outcome of a coin flip is equally likely to be heads or tails, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome of the coin flip is low. On the other hand, if you don't know whether the coin is fair or not, then the outcome of the coin flip is more uncertain, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome is higher.



In information theory, the concept of entropy is used to quantify the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. The more uncertainty or randomness there is, the higher the entropy. Information theory also introduces the concept of mutual information, which is a measure of the amount of information that one random variable contains about another.



Information theory has applications in a wide range of fields, including computer science, engineering, and statistics. It is used to design efficient communication systems, to compress data, to analyze statistical data, and to study the limits of computation.",1

human_76,"In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω ""I find, discover"") is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution.  This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed.  In a way, it can be considered a shortcut.
A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.",0
ai_77,"In computer science, a heuristic is a technique that allows a computer program to find a solution to a problem more quickly than would be possible using an algorithm that guarantees a correct solution. Heuristics are often used when an exact solution is not necessary or when it is not feasible to find an exact solution because of the amount of time or resources it would require.



Heuristics are typically used to solve optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution out of a set of possible solutions. For example, in the traveling salesman problem, the goal is to find the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. An algorithm that guarantees a correct solution to this problem would be very slow, so heuristics are often used instead to quickly find a solution that is close to the optimal one.



Heuristics can be very effective, but they are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, and the quality of the solution they find may vary depending on the specific problem and the heuristic used. As a result, it is important to carefully evaluate the quality of the solutions found by a heuristic and to consider whether an exact solution is necessary in a particular context.",1

ai_95,"Fifth generation computers, also known as 5G computers, refer to a class of computers that were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s with the goal of creating intelligent machines that could perform tasks that normally require human-level intelligence. These computers were intended to be able to reason, learn, and adapt to new situations in a way that is similar to how humans think and solve problems.



Fifth generation computers were characterized by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as expert systems, natural language processing, and machine learning, to enable them to perform tasks that require a high degree of knowledge and decision-making ability. They were also designed to be highly parallel, meaning that they could perform many tasks at the same time, and to be able to handle large amounts of data efficiently.



Some examples of fifth generation computers include the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) project, which was a research project funded by the Japanese government in the 1980s to develop advanced AI-based computer systems, and the IBM Deep Blue computer, which was a fifth generation computer that was able to defeat the world chess champion in 1997.



Today, many modern computers are considered to be fifth generation computers or beyond, as they incorporate advanced AI and machine learning capabilities and are able to perform a wide range of tasks that require human-level intelligence.",1
human_96,"Research is ""creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge"". It involves the collection, organization and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic, characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error.  These activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases. A research project may be an expansion on past work in the field. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.
The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.",0

It is a systematic and critical investigation of a specific topic, and it is typically carried out by scholars and researchers in academia, which includes universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher education.



Academic research is a critical component of the academic enterprise, as it allows scholars to contribute new insights and understanding to their fields of study. This can involve studying a particular topic in depth, conducting experiments or surveys, analyzing data, or examining primary or secondary sources.



Academic research is typically conducted in a formalized setting, such as a university or research institute, and it is often funded by grants or other sources of financial support. Researchers are expected to follow established guidelines and protocols in conducting their research, and to report their findings in a clear and transparent manner.



The results of academic research are typically published in academic journals, conference proceedings, or other scholarly publications, and are subject to peer review by other researchers in the field. This helps to ensure the quality and integrity of the research, and to ensure that new knowledge is disseminated widely within the academic community.",1

human_100,"Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. These activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field of application, and they have undergone substantial development over the past few decades.
Pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled ""training"" data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
In machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is ""spam""). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.
Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform ""most likely"" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors.",0
ai_101,"Pattern recognition is the process of identifying patterns and regularities in data. It involves analyzing and interpreting sensory data in order to recognize and classify it based on certain criteria.

There are many different types of patterns that can be recognized, including visual patterns, audio patterns, and text patterns. Pattern recognition algorithms can be used to identify and classify objects in images, recognize spoken words, or identify patterns in financial data.



The process of pattern recognition involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In the data collection step, raw data is collected from sensors or other sources. Preprocessing involves cleaning and organizing the data to make it more suitable for analysis. Feature extraction involves identifying the most important characteristics of the data, which will be used to classify it. Finally, the data is classified based on the patterns that have been identified.

ai_108,"Soft computing is a field of study that focuses on the design and development of computational systems and algorithms that are inspired by, or mimic, human cognition, perception, and behavior. These systems and algorithms are often referred to as ""soft"" because they are designed to be flexible, adaptable, and tolerant of uncertainty, imprecision, and partial truth.



Soft computing approaches differ from traditional ""hard"" computing approaches in that they are designed to handle complex, ill-defined, or poorly understood problems, as well as to process data that is noisy, incomplete, or uncertain. Soft computing techniques include a wide range of methods, including artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning, among others.

ai_110,"A fuzzy system is a computational system that uses fuzzy logic, a mathematical logic that allows for uncertainty and imprecision in the form of partial truth values, to make decisions or predictions. Fuzzy systems are used in a variety of applications, including control systems, artificial intelligence, image processing, and data analysis.



Fuzzy logic differs from classical Boolean logic, which represents values as either true or false, in that it allows for values to be partially true or false. This is represented by membership values, which can range from 0 to 1 and represent the degree to which a particular value belongs to a certain set or category. For example, a membership value of 0.7 for the set ""hot"" might indicate that a particular temperature is quite hot, while a membership value of 0.3 for the set ""cold"" might indicate that it is only somewhat cold.



Fuzzy systems use fuzzy logic to process input data and make decisions based on that data. They typically consist of a set of rules that define how the input data should be processed, as well as a set of membership functions that map the input data to membership values. The output of a fuzzy system is typically a crisp value, which is a single value that represents the final decision or prediction made by the system.



Fuzzy systems are often used in situations where there is a need to make decisions based on imprecise or incomplete data, or where there are multiple conflicting objectives that need to be balanced. They are particularly useful in control systems, where they can be used to stabilize processes or adjust system parameters in real-time.",1

However, neither of these idealized situations ever occurs in real world problems.

human_113,"In computer science, evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution, and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character.
In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a population of solutions is subjected to natural selection (or artificial selection) and mutation. As a result, the population will gradually evolve to increase in fitness, in this case the chosen fitness function of the algorithm.
Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in computer science. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in evolutionary biology as an in silico experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.",0

There are several subfields within evolutionary computation, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies. Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection and use techniques such as crossover (combining pieces of two solutions to create a new one) and mutation (randomly altering a solution) to generate new solutions from the existing population. Genetic programming involves using genetic algorithms to evolve programs that can solve a given problem. Evolutionary strategies use a different set of techniques, such as evolutionarily stable strategies, to evolve solutions.

An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies.
A number of upper ontologies have been proposed, each with its own proponents.
Library classification systems predate upper ontology systems. Though library classifications organize and categorize knowledge using general concepts that are the same across all knowledge domains, neither system is a replacement for the other.",0

Upper ontologies are often used as a starting point for building domain ontologies, which are more specific to a particular subject area or application.



The purpose of an upper ontology is to provide a common language that can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in a given domain. It is intended to provide a set of general concepts that can be used to classify and organize the more specific concepts and categories used in a domain ontology. An upper ontology can help to reduce the complexity and ambiguity of a domain by providing a shared, standardized vocabulary that can be used to describe the concepts and relationships within that domain.



Upper ontologies are often developed using formal methods, such as first-order logic, and may be implemented using a variety of technologies, including ontology languages like OWL or RDF.

human_119,"In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.
Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. 
Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.
For instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).
What ontologies in both computer science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).
Applied ontology is considered a successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles, the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes.

Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.
Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.
The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest.
In October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009. This new version, called OWL 2, soon found its way into semantic editors such as Protégé and semantic reasoners such as Pellet, RacerPro, FaCT++[10] and HermiT.[11]

Default logic can express facts like “by default, something is true”; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false.

This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified.

This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a ""reasonable"" way (see inductive bias). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured through the so-called generalization error.",0
ai_128,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which a model is trained to make predictions based on a set of labeled data. In supervised learning, the data used to train the model includes both input data and corresponding correct output labels. The goal of the model is to learn a function that maps the input data to the correct output labels, so that it can make predictions on unseen data.



For example, if we wanted to build a supervised learning model to predict the price of a house based on its size and location, we would need a dataset of houses with known prices. We would use this dataset to train the model by feeding it input data (size and location of the house) and the corresponding correct output label (price of the house). Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on houses for which the price is unknown.



There are two main types of supervised learning: classification and regression. Classification involves predicting a class label (e.g., ""cat"" or ""dog""), while regression involves predicting a continuous value (e.g., the price of a house).



In summary, supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model is trained to map the input data to the correct output labels, and can be used for either classification or regression tasks.",1
human_129,"In statistics, classification is the problem of identifying which of a set of categories (sub-populations) an observation (or observations) belongs to.  Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).
Often, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously as explanatory variables or features.  These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. ""A"", ""B"", ""AB"" or ""O"", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. ""large"", ""medium"" or ""small""), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Other classifiers work by comparing observations to previous observations by means of a similarity or distance function.
An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier.  The term ""classifier"" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.
Terminology across fields is quite varied. In statistics, where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of observations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables, regressors, etc.), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes, which are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable.  In machine learning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory variables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible categories to be predicted are classes.  Other fields may use different terminology: e.g. in community ecology, the term ""classification"" normally refers to cluster analysis.",0
ai_130,"Statistical classification is a supervised learning method in machine learning and statistics that involves learning how to assign class labels to input data based on some training data. The goal of statistical classification is to build a model that can predict the class label of an input data point based on one or more features.



To do this, we first need to collect a set of training data that includes input data points and their corresponding class labels. This training data is used to build a classifier, which is a mathematical model that maps the input data to the class labels. The classifier is then used to predict the class label of new, unseen data points based on their features.



There are many different algorithms that can be used for statistical classification, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The choice of algorithm will depend on the nature of the data and the desired performance of the classifier.



Statistical classification is commonly used in a wide range of applications, including spam filtering, image classification, and credit fraud detection.",1
human_131,"In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine learning parlance) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).
Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes.
First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning.
Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using  observational data.",0
ai_132,"Regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between variables. It involves fitting a mathematical model to a set of data points that are correlated, in order to make predictions about the behavior of one variable based on the behavior of the other variable.



In regression analysis, one variable is considered the independent variable and the other variable is considered the dependent variable. The goal is to develop a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the two variables, such that changes in the independent variable are related to changes in the dependent variable. The model is used to make predictions about the dependent variable based on known values of the independent variable.



There are many types of regression analysis, including linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression. The specific type of regression used depends on the nature of the data and the research question being addressed. Regression analysis is a widely used statistical tool in many fields, including economics, psychology, and engineering.",1
human_133,"Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.  This area of research bears some relation to the long history of psychological literature on transfer of learning, although practical ties between the two fields are limited. From the practical standpoint, reusing or transferring information from previously learned tasks for the learning of new tasks has the potential to significantly improve the sample efficiency of a reinforcement learning agent.",0
ai_134,"Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. It involves taking a pre-trained model, and fine-tuning it to the new task by updating the model's weights with new data.



The idea behind transfer learning is that the features learned by a model on one task can be useful for other tasks as well. For example, a model that has learned to recognize patterns in images of animals could potentially be fine-tuned to recognize patterns in images of plants. The model would not need to start from scratch and learn about image recognition from scratch, but could instead build upon the knowledge it has already gained.



Transfer learning is often used when the dataset for the new task is small and does not have enough data to train a model from scratch. It can also be used to improve the performance of a model on a new task by taking advantage of the features learned on the previous task.



Overall, transfer learning is a powerful technique that can help machine learning practitioners build more accurate and efficient models, especially when working with limited data.",1
ai_135,"Computational learning theory is a subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science that deals with the study of how computers can learn from data. It is concerned with understanding the computational principles underlying machine learning algorithms and their performance limits.



In general, machine learning algorithms are used to build models that can make predictions or decisions based on data. These models are usually built by training the algorithm on a dataset, which consists of input data and corresponding output labels. The goal of the learning process is to find a model that accurately predicts the output labels for new, unseen data.



Computational learning theory aims to understand the fundamental limits of this process, as well as the computational complexity of different learning algorithms. It also investigates the relationship between the complexity of the learning task and the amount of data required to learn it.



Some of the key concepts in computational learning theory include the concept of a ""hypothesis space,"" which is the set of all possible models that can be learned by the algorithm, and the concept of ""generalization,"" which refers to the ability of the learned model to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.



Overall, computational learning theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, as well as for understanding the limitations of these algorithms.",1
human_136,"In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.
The study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. 
As the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer. Space complexity is generally expressed as the amount of memory required by an algorithm on an input of size n.",0
ai_137,"Computational complexity is a field of computer science that studies the amount of resources (such as time and space) required to solve problems using algorithms. It is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, and it helps to determine the feasibility of an algorithm for solving a particular problem.



In computational complexity theory, the resources that are typically analyzed include time (measured in number of steps or operations) and space (measured in amount of memory). An algorithm is considered to be efficient if it can solve a problem in a reasonable amount of time and space, given the size of the input. On the other hand, an algorithm that requires an unreasonable amount of time or space to solve a problem is considered to be inefficient.



There are several different measures of computational complexity, including time complexity, space complexity, and overall complexity. Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time required to solve a problem using an algorithm, while space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory required to solve the problem. Overall complexity is a measure of both time and space complexity.



Computational complexity theory is an important field in computer science because it helps to identify the limits of what can be computed efficiently and to design algorithms that are as efficient as possible. It also helps to understand the trade-offs between different algorithms and to choose the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem.",1
human_138,"The sample complexity of a machine learning algorithm represents the number of training-samples that it needs in order to successfully learn a target function.
More precisely, the sample complexity is the number of training-samples that we need to supply to the algorithm, so that the function returned by the algorithm is within an arbitrarily small error of the best possible function, with probability arbitrarily close to 1.
There are two variants of sample complexity:
The No free lunch theorem, discussed below, proves that, in general, the strong sample complexity is infinite, i.e. that there is no algorithm that can learn the globally-optimal target function using a finite number of training samples.
However, if we are only interested in a particular class of target functions (e.g, only linear functions) then the sample complexity is finite, and it depends linearly on the VC dimension on the class of target functions.",0
ai_139,"Sample complexity refers to the number of training examples or samples that a machine learning algorithm requires in order to be able to accurately learn a task or make accurate predictions. It is a measure of how much data the algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain level of performance.



In general, the more complex the task or the more noise or variability in the data, the more samples the algorithm will need in order to learn the task accurately. Conversely, if the task is simple or the data is very clean and well-organized, the algorithm may require fewer samples in order to learn the task.



Sample complexity is an important consideration when designing and implementing machine learning algorithms, as it can have a significant impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. For example, an algorithm with low sample complexity may be able to learn a task quickly and accurately with a small amount of data, while an algorithm with high sample complexity may require a large amount of data and may take longer to learn the task.",1

It is generally divided into two subfields: discrete optimization and continuous optimization. Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.
In the more general approach, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics.

Natural-language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural-language processing and computational linguistics. An intuitive general natural-language interface is one of the active goals of the Semantic Web.

human_147,"Machine translation, sometimes referred to by the abbreviation MT (not to be confused with computer-aided translation, machine-aided human translation or interactive translation), is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another.
On a basic level, MT performs mechanical substitution of words in one language for words in another, but that alone rarely produces a good translation because recognition of whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language is needed. Not all words in one language have equivalent words in another language, and many words have more than one meaning. 
Solving this problem with corpus statistical and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies.[failed verification]
Current machine translation software often allows for customization by domain or profession (such as weather reports), improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions. This technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used. It follows that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than machine translation of conversation or less standardised text.
Improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention: for example, some systems are able to translate more accurately if the user has unambiguously identified which words in the text are proper names. With the assistance of these techniques, MT has proven useful as a tool to assist human translators and, in a very limited number of cases, can even produce output that can be used as is (e.g., weather reports).
The progress and potential of machine translation have been much debated through its history. Since the 1950s, a number of scholars, first and most notably Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, have questioned the possibility of achieving fully automatic machine translation of high quality.",0

human_149,"Deep structure and surface structure (also D-structure and S-structure although those abbreviated forms are sometimes used with distinct meanings) are concepts used in linguistics, specifically in the study of syntax in the Chomskyan tradition of transformational generative grammar.
The deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures.  For example, the sentences ""Pat loves Chris"" and ""Chris is loved by Pat"" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.  Some linguists, Chomsky in particular, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common (or very similar) deep structure.",0
ai_150,"In linguistics, the term ""deep structure"" refers to the underlying meaning and structure of a sentence or phrase, which is thought to be the source of the surface structure or the way that the sentence is actually expressed. This concept was developed by Noam Chomsky and his followers as part of their theory of transformational grammar, which proposes that the deep structure of a sentence is transformed into its surface structure through a series of rules.



According to this theory, the deep structure of a sentence consists of the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships between the words and phrases in the sentence. It is thought to be the source of the various surface structures that a sentence can have, depending on the context in which it is used and the rules that are applied to transform it.



For example, consider the following sentence: ""The cat sat on the mat."" This sentence has a simple deep structure that consists of a subject (""the cat""), a verb (""sat""), and an object (""the mat""). The surface structure of this sentence is the specific way that it is expressed, with the words arranged in a particular order and with specific inflections applied to the verb.



Deep structure is an important concept in linguistics because it helps to explain how the meaning of a sentence is conveyed and how different surface structures can be derived from a single deep structure. It is also a key component of many theories of language and how it is processed in the brain.",1
human_151,"In theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.
A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.
Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.",0
ai_152,"Intractability, also known as complexity, refers to the difficulty of solving a problem or completing a task using a computer algorithm. Some problems are easy to solve and can be completed quickly by a computer, while others are much more difficult and may take a long time or even be impossible to solve using current technology.



Intractability can be a result of the size of the problem, the number of steps required to solve the problem, or the amount of resources (such as time or memory) needed to solve the problem. It can also be caused by the inherent complexity of the problem itself, such as when the problem requires a large amount of computation or when the problem is not well-defined.



Some examples of intractable problems include the traveling salesman problem, the shortest path problem, and the knapsack problem. These problems are difficult to solve because they require a large amount of computation or because there are a large number of possible solutions that must be considered.



Intractability is an important concept in computer science and can have significant implications for the design and implementation of algorithms and computer systems. Understanding the complexity of a problem can help researchers and engineers determine the feasibility of solving the problem using current technology and can inform the development of new algorithms and approaches for solving difficult problems.",1

human_155,"Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.
Some speech recognition systems require ""training"" (also called ""enrollment"") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called ""speaker-independent"" systems. Systems that use training are called ""speaker dependent"".
Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. ""call home""), call routing (e.g. ""I would like to make a collect call""), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).
The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.
From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data.

Development began on similar systems in the 1960s, beginning as a form of computer application. Since their inception, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human's physiological characteristics, facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless process. Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human–computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of images.
Facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies. Their effectiveness varies, and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness. The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy, with claims that the systems violate citizens' privacy, commonly make incorrect identifications, encourage gender norms and racial profiling, and do not protect important biometric data. The appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security. These claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the United States.

ai_159,"In psychology, affect refers to the emotional aspect of experience. It is a term that encompasses a range of emotional states, including feelings, moods, and emotions.



Affect can be positive, such as feelings of joy or happiness, or negative, such as feelings of sadness or anger. It can be temporary, lasting only for a short period of time, or more enduring, lasting for a longer period.



Affect plays an important role in how people experience and respond to the world around them. It influences how people think, feel, and behave, and it can also affect physical health and well-being.



There are several theories about how affect is generated and how it influences behavior. One theory is that affect is a response to stimuli in the environment, such as events or experiences that are either positive or negative. Another theory is that affect is influenced by internal factors, such as thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes.



Understanding affect and how it influences behavior is important in a variety of fields, including psychology, psychiatry, and counseling. It is also relevant to fields such as education, where understanding students' emotional states can help teachers create a positive learning environment.",1

human_162,"Human–computer interaction (HCI) is research in the design and the use of computer technology, which focuses on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways. A device that allows interaction between human being and a computer is known as a ""Human-computer Interface (HCI)"".
As a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study. The term was popularized by Stuart K. Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P. Moran in their 1983 book, The Psychology of Human–Computer Interaction. The first known use was in 1975 by Carlisle. The term is intended to convey that, unlike other tools with specific and limited uses, computers have many uses which often involve an open-ended dialogue between the user and the computer. The notion of dialogue likens human–computer interaction to human-to-human interaction: an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.",0

human_166,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is a new dimension[peacock prose] of the traditional text-based sentiment analysis, which goes beyond the analysis of texts, and includes other modalities such as audio and visual data. It can be bimodal, which includes different combinations of two modalities, or trimodal, which incorporates three modalities. With the extensive amount of social media data available online in different forms such as videos and images, the conventional text-based sentiment analysis has evolved into more complex models of multimodal sentiment analysis, which can be applied in the development of  virtual assistants, analysis of YouTube movie reviews, analysis of news videos, and emotion recognition (sometimes known as emotion detection) such as depression monitoring, among others.
Similar to the traditional sentiment analysis, one of the most basic task in multimodal sentiment analysis is sentiment classification, which classifies different sentiments into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The complexity of analyzing text, audio, and visual features to perform such a task requires the application of different fusion techniques, such as feature-level, decision-level, and hybrid fusion. The performance of these fusion techniques and the classification algorithms applied, are influenced by the type of textual, audio, and visual features employed in the analysis.",0

For example, a person's tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language may all convey important information about their sentiment that cannot be captured by analyzing just their words. By analyzing multiple modalities, it is possible to more accurately understand the sentiment being expressed and to identify subtle or complex emotions that may not be apparent when analyzing only a single modality.

Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning.
Despite considerable overlap, a multi-agent system is not always the same as an agent-based model (ABM).  The goal of an ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents (which don't necessarily need to be ""intelligent"") obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in solving specific practical or engineering problems. The terminology of ABM tends to be used more often in the science, and MAS in engineering and technology.

human_176,"An artificial brain (or artificial mind) is software and hardware with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or human brain.
Research investigating ""artificial brains"" and brain emulation plays three important roles in science:
An example of the first objective is the project reported by Aston University in Birmingham, England where researchers are using biological cells to create ""neurospheres"" (small clusters of neurons) in order to develop new treatments for diseases including Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's disease.
The second objective is a reply to arguments such as John Searle's Chinese room argument, Hubert Dreyfus's critique of AI or Roger Penrose's argument in The Emperor's New Mind. These critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines. One reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy. This reply was made as early as 1950, by Alan Turing in his classic paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"".[note 1]
The third objective is generally called artificial general intelligence by researchers. However, Ray Kurzweil prefers the term ""strong AI"". In his book The Singularity is Near, he focuses on whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains, and claims (on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend) that this could be done by 2025.

The typical methodological approach consists in starting from theories of human and animal development elaborated in fields such as developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental and evolutionary biology, and linguistics, then to formalize and implement them in robots, sometimes exploring extensions or variants of them. The experimentation of those models in robots allows researchers to confront them with reality, and as a consequence, developmental robotics also provides feedback and novel hypotheses on theories of human and animal development.

human_180,"Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?  All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.
Logical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.
Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language

The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.",0
ai_181,"In logic, a logical consequence is a statement that follows logically from one or more statements. In other words, if the statements are true, then the logical consequence must also be true.



For example, consider the following statements:



All cats are mammals.

Fluffy is a cat.

From these statements, we can conclude that Fluffy is a mammal. This conclusion follows logically from the first two statements and is therefore a logical consequence of them.



Logical consequences are important in logical reasoning because they allow us to draw conclusions and make inferences based on the information that we have. They are also important in mathematics, where they are used to prove theorems and other statements.",1
human_182,"In the philosophy of logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form ""If p then q"" and another in the form ""p"", and returns the conclusion ""q"". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.
Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.
Popular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.",0
ai_183,"Inference rules are logical rules that allow you to draw conclusions from given information. They are used in logic and mathematics to deduce new statements based on existing statements, and they can be used to prove the validity of a logical argument or to solve a mathematical problem.



There are two main types of inference rules: deductive and inductive.



Deductive inference rules allow you to draw conclusions that are necessarily true based on given information. For example, if you know that all mammals are warm-blooded, and you know that a particular animal is a mammal, you can deduce that the animal is warm-blooded. This is an example of a deductive inference rule called modus ponens.



Inductive inference rules allow you to draw conclusions that are likely to be true based on given information. For example, if you observe that a particular coin has landed heads up 10 times in a row, you might conclude that the coin is biased toward landing heads up. This is an example of an inductive inference rule.

For example, the configuration space of a single particle moving in three-dimensional space is simply three-dimensional space itself, with each point in the space representing a possible position of the particle.



In more complex systems, the configuration space can be a higher-dimensional space. For example, the configuration space of a system of two particles in three-dimensional space would be six-dimensional, with each point in the space representing a possible position and orientation of the two particles.



Configuration space is also used in the study of quantum mechanics, where it is used to describe the possible states of a quantum system. In this context, the configuration space is often referred to as the ""Hilbert space"" or ""state space"" of the system.

Although search engines use search algorithms, they belong to the study of information retrieval, not algorithmics.
The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as search trees, hash maps, and database indexes.[full citation needed]
Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys. Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.
Algorithms are often evaluated by their computational complexity, or maximum theoretical run time. Binary search functions, for example, have a maximum complexity of O(log n), or logarithmic time. In simple terms, the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space.",0

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that involves looking through each item in a list, one by one, until the desired item is found. This method is relatively slow, especially for large lists, but it is easy to understand and implement.



Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that is used on sorted lists. It works by dividing the list in half and checking to see if the desired item is in the first or second half. If it is not, the algorithm repeats the process on the appropriate half until the item is found or it is determined that the item is not in the list.



Depth-first search is a search algorithm used for traversing tree data structures. It involves exploring as far as possible down one branch before backtracking and exploring other branches. Depth-first search can be used to find specific items in a tree or to traverse the entire tree for some other purpose.

human_192,"In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.
Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.: 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity.

In some cases, it may be necessary to optimize algorithms and programs to reduce computation time in order to meet performance goals or to improve the user experience.",1
human_194,"Pruning is a data compression technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that are non-critical and redundant to classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.
One of the questions that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree.  A tree that is too large risks overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples.  A small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space.  However, it is hard to tell when a tree algorithm should stop because it is impossible to tell if the addition of a single extra node will dramatically decrease error.  This problem is known as the horizon effect.  A common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information.
Pruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross-validation set.  There are many techniques for tree pruning that differ in the measurement that is used to optimize performance.",0
ai_195,"Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size of a machine learning model by removing unnecessary parameters or connections. The goal of pruning is to improve the efficiency and speed of the model without significantly affecting its accuracy.



There are several ways to prune a machine learning model, and the most common method is to remove weights that have a small magnitude. This can be done during the training process by setting a threshold for the weight values and eliminating those that fall below it. Another method is to remove connections between neurons that have a small impact on the model's output.



Pruning can be used to reduce the complexity of a model, which can make it easier to interpret and understand. It can also help to prevent overfitting, which is when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.



In summary, pruning is a technique used to reduce the size and complexity of a machine learning model while maintaining or improving its performance.",1
human_196,"In computer science, a search tree is a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. In order for a tree to function as a search tree, the key for each node must be greater than any keys in subtrees on the left, and less than any keys in subtrees on the right.
The advantage of search trees is their efficient search time given the tree is reasonably balanced, which is to say the leaves at either end are of comparable depths. Various search-tree data structures exist, several of which also allow efficient insertion and deletion of elements, which operations then have to maintain tree balance.
Search trees are often used to implement an associative array. The search tree algorithm uses the key from the key–value pair to find a location, and then the application stores the entire key–value pair at that particular location.",0
ai_197,"A search tree is a data structure that is used to store a collection of items such that each item has a unique search key. The search tree is organized in such a way that it allows for efficient search and insertion of items. Search trees are commonly used in computer science and are an important data structure for many algorithms and applications.



There are several different types of search trees, each with its own specific characteristics and uses. Some common types of search trees include binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.



In a search tree, each node in the tree represents an item and has a search key associated with it. The search key is used to determine the position of the node in the tree. Each node also has one or more child nodes, which represent the items stored in the tree. The child nodes of a node are organized in a specific way, such that the search key of a node's child is either greater than or less than the search key of the parent node. This organization allows for efficient search and insertion of items in the tree.



Search trees are used in a wide variety of applications, including databases, file systems, and data compression algorithms. They are known for their efficient search and insertion capabilities, as well as their ability to store and retrieve data in a sorted manner.",1
human_198,"Mathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or mathematical programming is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives. It is generally divided into two subfields: discrete optimization and continuous optimization. Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.
In the more general approach, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics. More generally, optimization includes finding ""best available"" values of some objective function given a defined domain (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.",0
ai_199,"Optimization, in mathematics, refers to the process of finding the maximum or minimum value of a function. This can be expressed as a problem of the form:



Given a function f(x) and a set of constraints on the variables x, find the values of x that minimize or maximize the function f(x).



Optimization problems can be classified into two types: linear and nonlinear. Linear optimization problems involve functions that are linear in the variables, while nonlinear optimization problems involve functions that are not linear.



There are many different techniques for solving optimization problems, including gradient descent, the simplex method, and the Newton-Raphson method. The choice of method will depend on the specific problem being solved and the characteristics of the function being optimized.



Optimization techniques are widely used in fields such as engineering, economics, and computer science to solve a variety of practical problems. For example, optimization can be used to design efficient transportation systems, to optimize the production of goods and services, and to find the best strategy for solving a problem in computer science.",1
human_200,"In numerical analysis, hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search. It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.
For example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.
Hill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems – for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space). Examples of algorithms that solve convex problems by hill-climbing include the simplex algorithm for linear programming and binary search.: 253  To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).
The relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems, so long as a small number of increments typically converges on a good solution (the optimal solution or a close approximation). At the other extreme, bubble sort can be viewed as a hill climbing algorithm (every adjacent element exchange decreases the number of disordered element pairs), yet this approach is far from efficient for even modest N, as the number of exchanges required grows quadratically. 
Hill climbing is an anytime algorithm: it can return a valid solution even if it's interrupted at any time before it ends.",0
ai_201,"Hill climbing is a heuristic search algorithm that is used to find the local maximum or minimum of a function. The algorithm starts at a randomly chosen point on the function and then iteratively moves to a neighboring point that has a higher value, until it reaches a point where no neighboring point has a higher value. This point is then considered to be the local maximum or minimum of the function.



The algorithm can be described as follows:



Choose a starting point on the function.

Evaluate the value of the function at the starting point.

Check the neighboring points to see if any of them have a higher value than the current point. If so, move to the neighboring point with the highest value.

Repeat step 3 until no neighboring point has a higher value than the current point.

Hill climbing is a simple and effective algorithm, but it has some limitations. It can get stuck in local maxima or minima, which are points that are not the global maximum or minimum of the function but are still the highest or lowest point in their immediate vicinity. In addition, the algorithm does not guarantee that it will find the global maximum or minimum of the function, only the local maximum or minimum.",1
human_202,"Random optimization (RO) is a family of numerical optimization methods that do not require the gradient of the problem to be optimized and RO can hence be used on functions that are not continuous or differentiable. Such optimization methods are also known as direct-search, derivative-free, or black-box methods.
The name random optimization is attributed to Matyas  who made an early presentation of RO along with basic mathematical analysis. RO works by iteratively moving to better positions in the search-space which are sampled using e.g. a normal distribution surrounding the current position.",0
ai_203,"Random optimization is a method for finding the optimal solution to a problem by using random search. It is a type of heuristic optimization algorithm that does not rely on any prior knowledge about the problem or use any specific search strategy. Instead, it relies on random sampling to explore the space of possible solutions, with the hope that the optimal solution will be found by chance.



In random optimization, a set of potential solutions to a problem is generated randomly, and the quality of each solution is evaluated using a predefined objective function. The process is repeated a number of times, and the best solution found is retained as the result.



Random optimization can be useful when the search space is large and it is not possible to use more sophisticated optimization algorithms, or when the problem is too complex to allow for the development of a specific search strategy. However, it is generally less efficient than other optimization methods, as it relies on random chance rather than a systematic search.",1
human_204,"In computer science, beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements. Best-first search is a graph search which orders all partial solutions (states) according to some heuristic. But in beam search, only a predetermined number of best partial solutions are kept as candidates. It is thus a greedy algorithm.
The term ""beam search"" was coined by Raj Reddy of Carnegie Mellon University in 1977.",0
ai_205,"Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. It is an optimization of breadth-first search that allows the search to trade completeness for speed by limiting the number of nodes that it expands.



In a breadth-first search, the algorithm expands every node in the current layer before moving on to the next layer. This can be computationally expensive if the graph is large or the layers are deep. Beam search tries to balance the trade-off between completeness and efficiency by expanding a fixed number of nodes, known as the beam width, at each layer.



For example, if the beam width is set to 3, the algorithm will only expand the 3 most promising nodes at each layer. This means that the search may not find the optimal solution, but it will be faster than a breadth-first search.



Beam search is often used in natural language processing and machine translation to find the most likely sequence of words in a language model. It is also used in other areas such as computer vision and robotics to find the most likely sequence of actions.",1
human_206,"Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound.
The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.
Simulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems.
The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.
Similar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.
This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.
The simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method. The method is an adaptation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system, published by N. Metropolis et al. in 1953.",0
ai_207,"Simulated annealing is a heuristic optimization method used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. It is inspired by the annealing process used in metallurgy to purify and strengthen metals, in which a material is heated to a high temperature and then slowly cooled.



In simulated annealing, a random initial solution is generated and the algorithm iteratively improves the solution by making small random changes to it. These changes are accepted or rejected based on a probability function that is related to the difference in value between the current solution and the new solution. The probability of accepting a new solution decreases as the algorithm progresses, which helps to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in a local minimum or maximum.



Simulated annealing is often used to solve optimization problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using other methods, such as problems with a large number of variables or problems with complex, non-differentiable objective functions. It is also useful for problems with many local minima or maxima, as it can escape from these local optima and explore other parts of the search space.



Simulated annealing is a useful tool for solving many types of optimization problems, but it can be slow and may not always find the global minimum or maximum. It is often used in combination with other optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the optimization process.",1
human_208,"Selective breeding (also called artificial selection) is the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together. Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, cultivars, or breeds. Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.
In animal breeding, techniques such as inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing are utilized. In plant breeding, similar methods are used. Charles Darwin discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons, cats, cattle, and dogs. Darwin used artificial selection as a springboard to introduce and support the theory of natural selection.
The deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.
Selective breeding can be unintentional, for example, resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended – desirable or undesirable – results. For example, in some grains, an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds. Most likely, there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication.",0
ai_209,"Artificial selection is a process by which humans breed plants and animals for specific traits or characteristics. It is a form of selective breeding in which humans deliberately choose which individuals will reproduce, based on their desired traits. This is in contrast to natural selection, which is the process by which traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction are passed on to future generations through the process of evolution.



Artificial selection has been used for thousands of years to breed domesticated animals and plants for various purposes, such as increasing their size, improving their flavor, or enhancing their appearance. For example, humans have bred cattle for meat, milk, and leather; dogs for hunting, herding, and guarding; and crops for yield, taste, and disease resistance.



Artificial selection can also be used in the laboratory setting to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In this process, scientists can use techniques such as gene editing to introduce specific traits into an organism's genome, or they can transfer genes from one organism to another using techniques such as genetic engineering.



Overall, artificial selection is a powerful tool that has had a significant impact on the diversity of plants and animals that we see today, and it continues to be an important area of research and development in the field of biology.",1
human_210,"In computational intelligence (CI), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.
Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.",0

EAs work by first creating a population of candidate solutions, also known as individuals or chromosones, which represent potential solutions to the optimization problem. These candidates are then evaluated using a fitness function, which measures the quality or effectiveness of each solution. The candidates with the highest fitness scores are selected to be the parents, and they are used to generate a new population of candidates through various techniques, such as crossover (combining elements from different parents) and mutation (randomly modifying elements of the parent). This process is repeated over a number of generations until a satisfactory solution is found, or until a predetermined number of generations have been reached.

These operators include selection, crossover (also known as recombination), and mutation.



During the process of a genetic algorithm, the individuals in the population are evaluated based on a fitness function that measures the quality of the solution they represent. The individuals with higher fitness values have a greater probability of being selected for the next generation.



The selected individuals are then combined through crossover, in which bits or numbers from one individual are combined with bits or numbers from another individual to create a new offspring. The offspring is then subjected to a mutation operator, which introduces random changes to the individual's bits or numbers.



This process is repeated over many generations, with the hope that the population will evolve towards better and better solutions to the problem.

Each node in the expression tree represents a function or terminal, and the branches represent the arguments of the function. The functions and terminals in the expression tree can be combined in a variety of ways to form a complete program or model.



To evolve a solution using GEP, a population of expression trees is first created. These trees are then evaluated according to some predefined fitness function, which measures how well the trees solve a particular problem. The trees that perform better are selected for reproduction, and new trees are created through a process of crossover and mutation. This process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found.

human_216,"In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is a technique of evolving programs, starting from a population of unfit (usually random) programs, fit for a particular task by applying operations analogous to natural genetic processes to the population of programs.
The operations are: selection of the fittest programs for reproduction (crossover) and mutation according to a predefined fitness measure, usually proficiency at the desired task.  The crossover operation involves swapping random parts of selected pairs (parents) to produce new and different offspring that become part of the new generation of programs.  Mutation involves substitution of some random part of a program with some other random part of a program. Some programs not selected for reproduction are copied from the current generation to the new generation. Then the selection and other operations are recursively applied to the new generation of programs.
Typically, members of each new generation are on average more fit than the members of the previous generation, and the best-of-generation program is often better than the best-of-generation programs from previous generations.  Termination of the evolution usually occurs when some individual program reaches a predefined proficiency or fitness level.
It may and often does happen that a particular run of the algorithm results in premature convergence to some local maximum which is not a globally optimal or even good solution.  Multiple runs (dozens to hundreds) are usually necessary to produce a very good result.

human_220,"In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.
PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive  survey of PSO applications is made by Poli. Recently, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.
PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods.

The position of each particle is updated using a combination of its own velocity and the best position it has encountered so far (the ""personal best"") as well as the best position encountered by the entire swarm (the ""global best""). The velocity of each particle is updated using a weighted combination of its current velocity and the position updates.



By iteratively updating the positions and velocities of the particles, the swarm can ""swarm"" around the global minimum or maximum of the function.

Computer simulations and mathematical models that have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviours of birds can also generally be applied to the ""flocking"" behaviour of other species. As a result, the term ""flocking"" is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds.
This article is about the modelling of flocking behaviour. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, ""flocking"" is the collective motion by a group of self-propelled entities and is a collective animal behaviour exhibited by many living beings such as birds, fish, bacteria, and  insects. It is considered an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.",0
ai_223,"Flocking is a type of coordinated group behavior that is exhibited by animals of various species, including birds, fish, and insects. It is characterized by the ability of the animals to move together in a coordinated and cohesive manner, as if they were a single entity.



Flocking behavior is thought to have evolved as a way for animals to increase their chances of survival by working together as a group. For example, flocking birds may be able to locate food more efficiently or defend themselves against predators more effectively when they work together. Flocking behavior is also thought to help animals stay together and maintain social bonds.



There are several different models that have been proposed to explain the mechanisms behind flocking behavior. One of the most well-known models is the ""boids"" model, which was developed by computer graphics researcher Craig Reynolds in 1986. This model describes the behavior of a flock of birds as being determined by three simple rules: separation (avoiding collisions with other members of the flock), alignment (tending to move in the same direction as other members of the flock), and cohesion (tending to stay close to other members of the flock).



Flocking behavior has been studied extensively in a variety of fields, including biology, computer science, and engineering. It has also been used as a model for the development of artificial intelligence and robotics, as it provides a simple yet powerful example of how complex group behavior can emerge from simple individual rules.",1
human_224,"In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. 
The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.   Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.
As an example, ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.  One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.
This algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms.",0
ai_225,"Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of ant colonies. Ant colonies are able to solve complex problems, such as finding the shortest path between their nest and a food source, by using simple rules and communication through pheromone trails. ACO algorithms use a similar process to find approximate solutions to optimization problems.



In ACO, a set of artificial ants is used to search for good solutions to the problem. Each ant builds a solution by constructing a path through a graph, with the quality of the solution being determined by the cost of the path. The ants communicate with each other through pheromone trails, which are used to indicate the desirability of different paths.



As the ants search for solutions, they leave pheromone trails on the paths they take. These trails serve as a kind of ""memory"" for the ants, allowing them to remember which paths are good and which are not. Over time, the pheromone trails on the most desirable paths become stronger, while the trails on less desirable paths fade away. This process allows the ants to adapt their search strategies as they learn more about the problem.



ACO algorithms have been applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including scheduling, routing, and resource allocation. They are particularly well suited to problems that involve finding the shortest path through a large, complex graph.",1
human_226,"Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.
Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called ""drones"" and one or more fertile females called ""queens"" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.
Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in moist tropical ecosystems and may exceed the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.
Ant societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems. These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rites. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) of South America, are regarded as invasive species in other parts of the world, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.",0
ai_227,"An ant trail is a path or route that ants follow as they move between their nest and a food source. Ants are social insects that live in colonies, and they communicate with each other using chemical signals called pheromones. When an ant finds a food source, it will lay down a trail of pheromones as it returns to the nest, allowing other ants to follow the scent and locate the food. This process is called ""trailing.""



Ant trails can be straight or winding, depending on the terrain and the availability of food. When an ant trail is well-established, it can be used by hundreds or even thousands of ants as they move back and forth between the nest and the food source. Ant trails are an example of how social insects use communication and cooperation to find resources and work together to achieve common goals.",1
human_228,"Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence  which uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesised logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples.
Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. The first full first-order implementation of inductive logic programming was Theorist in 1986.[citation needed] The term Inductive Logic Programming was first introduced in a paper by Stephen Muggleton in 1991. Muggleton also founded the annual international conference on Inductive Logic Programming, introduced the theoretical ideas of Predicate Invention, Inverse resolution, and Inverse entailment.[10] Muggleton implemented Inverse entailment first in the PROGOL system. The term ""inductive"" here refers to philosophical (i.e. suggesting a theory to explain observed facts) rather than mathematical (i.e. proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set) induction.",0
ai_229,"Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning that focuses on the development of algorithms and systems that can automatically construct logical rules and models from data.



In ILP, the goal is to learn logical rules that can be used to make predictions or classify examples based on a set of input features. These rules are typically represented in a logical language, such as first-order logic or propositional logic, and are learned from examples or training data using an inductive process.



The key idea behind ILP is to use logical reasoning and induction to learn rules from data. Induction is the process of inferring general principles or patterns from specific observations or examples. In the context of ILP, this means using a set of training examples to learn a set of logical rules that can be used to make predictions or classify new examples.



ILP has been applied to a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, biomedical informatics, and robotics. It has also been used to build expert systems and knowledge-based systems in domains such as medicine and biology.",1
human_230,"Propositional calculus is a branch of logic.  It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. Propositions that contain no logical connectives are called atomic propositions.
Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.",0
ai_231,"Propositional logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with statements (propositions) that are capable of being true or false. These statements are often referred to as ""propositions"" or ""atomic formulas"" because they cannot be broken down into simpler components.



In propositional logic, we use logical connectives such as ""and,"" ""or,"" and ""not"" to combine propositions into more complex statements. For example, if we have the propositions ""it is raining"" and ""the grass is wet,"" we can use the ""and"" connective to form the compound proposition ""it is raining and the grass is wet.""



Propositional logic is useful for representing and reasoning about the relationships between different statements, and it is the basis for more advanced logical systems such as predicate logic and modal logic.",1
human_232,"In logic, a truth function is a function that accepts truth values as input and produces a unique truth value as output. In other words: The input and output of a truth function are all truth values; a truth function will always output exactly one truth value; and inputting the same truth value(s) will always output the same truth value. The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives; if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and any logical connectives used are said to be truth functional.
Classical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function. On the other hand, modal logic is non-truth-functional.",0
ai_233,"A truth function, also known as a Boolean function, is a function in logic that takes in a number of input values and outputs a single true or false value. This output value is determined based on the truth or falsity of the input values according to the rules of propositional logic.



Truth functions are often used to represent logical statements, such as ""if it is raining, then the grass is wet"" or ""either the sky is blue or the grass is green."" These statements can be represented using truth functions by assigning truth values to the variables involved (e.g., ""raining"" is true, ""grass is wet"" is true) and applying the appropriate logical connectives (e.g., ""if-then,"" ""or"").



There are several common truth functions in propositional logic, including:



AND: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if both inputs are true, and false otherwise.

OR: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if at least one of the inputs is true, and false otherwise.

NOT: This function takes in a single input value and outputs the opposite value (e.g., true becomes false, and false becomes true).

IF-THEN: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if the first input (the ""if"" part) is false or the second input (the ""then"" part) is true, and false otherwise.

Truth functions are a fundamental concept in logic and are used in many different areas of computer science and mathematics, including computer programming, automated reasoning, and artificial intelligence.",1
human_234,"First-order logic—also known as predicate logic, quantificational logic, and first-order predicate calculus—is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ""Socrates is a man"", one can have expressions in the form ""there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man"", where ""there exists"" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations; in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.
A theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. Sometimes, ""theory"" is understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic.
The adjective ""first-order"" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates or functions, or both, are permitted.: 56  In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.
There are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (i.e., all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.
First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms, and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.
Peano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.
No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.
The foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce. For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001).",0
ai_235,"First-order logic (also known as first-order predicate calculus) is a formal logical system used to represent and reason about statements that contain variables, predicates, and logical connectives. It is called ""first-order"" because it allows quantification over individual variables, but not over predicates or functions.



In first-order logic, a formula is built up from atoms, which are either constants, variables, or predicates applied to variables. The atoms are combined using logical connectives such as ""and,"" ""or,"" ""not,"" and ""if-then."" Quantifiers such as ""for all"" and ""there exists"" can be used to express general statements about the variables.

human_236,"In logic, a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula. For instance, the universal quantifier 



∀

∀
x
P
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \forall xP(x)}

 expresses that everything in the domain satisfies the property denoted by

∃
x
P
(

{\displaystyle \exists xP(x)}

 expresses that there exists something in the domain which satisfies that property. A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula. A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable.
The mostly commonly used quantifiers are 



∀


{\displaystyle \forall }

 and 



∃


{\displaystyle \exists }

{\displaystyle \neg \exists xP(x)}

P

. Other quantifiers are only definable within second order logic or higher order logics. Quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström.
In a first-order logic statement, quantifications in the same type (either universal quantifications or existential quantifications) can be exchanged without changing the meaning of the statement, while the exchange of quantifications in different types changes the meaning. As an example, the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is the order of quantifications.
First order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as ""some"" and ""all"". However, many natural language quantifiers can only be analyzed in terms of generalized quantifiers.",0
ai_237,"In logic, a quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies the quantity or extent of the elements in the domain of a logical statement. There are two types of quantifiers: universal quantifiers and existential quantifiers.



A universal quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies that a particular statement holds for all elements in the domain of the statement. For example, the statement ""For all x, x is a number"" is a universal statement because it asserts that the property of being a number holds for every element in the domain of x. In symbolic logic, the universal quantifier is usually represented by the symbol ""∀"".



An existential quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies that there exists at least one element in the domain of a logical statement that satisfies a particular condition. For example, the statement ""There exists an x such that x is a prime number"" is an existential statement because it asserts that there is at least one element in the domain of x that is a prime number. In symbolic logic, the existential quantifier is usually represented by the symbol ""∃"".



Quantifiers play a crucial role in formal logic and are used to make more complex statements about the relationships between different elements in a logical domain. They are used to specify the extent to which a particular property holds for a given set of elements, and can be combined with other logical operators to form more complex statements.",1

ai_239,"In mathematical logic, a predicate is a statement that can be either true or false, depending on the values of its variables. For example, ""x is greater than y"" is a predicate, because it is either true or false depending on the values of x and y. Predicates are often used to define the properties of a set or the relationship between different elements in a set.



In formal logic, predicates are usually written using a capital letter followed by a sequence of variables. For example, ""P(x)"" is a predicate that takes a single variable x. ""Q(x,y)"" is a predicate that takes two variables, x and y. The values of the variables are often referred to as arguments of the predicate.



Predicates can be combined using logical connectives such as ""and"", ""or"", and ""not"" to form more complex statements. For example, ""P(x) and Q(x,y)"" is a predicate that is true if both P(x) and Q(x,y) are true.

human_240,"Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.
The term fuzzy logic was introduced with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy set theory by Iranian Azerbaijani mathematician Lotfi Zadeh.  Fuzzy logic had, however,  been studied since the 1920s, as infinite-valued logic—notably by Łukasiewicz and Tarski.
Fuzzy logic is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information. Fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information (hence the term fuzzy). These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.
Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from control theory to artificial intelligence.",0
ai_241,"Fuzzy logic is a type of mathematical logic that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than precise. It is used to represent the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Fuzzy logic has been used in a wide range of applications, including artificial intelligence, control systems, and decision-making.



In fuzzy logic, a statement can have a truth value that is a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents complete falsehood and 1 represents complete truth. This allows for more flexibility in representing uncertain or imprecise information. For example, the statement ""It is very cold outside"" might have a truth value of 0.9, while the statement ""It is slightly cold outside"" might have a truth value of 0.5.



Fuzzy logic systems use fuzzy rules to make decisions based on imprecise or incomplete data. These rules are written in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the antecedent (IF part) is a fuzzy set and the consequent (THEN part) is a crisp value. For example, a fuzzy rule might be written as:



IF temperature IS cold THEN heater ON



In this rule, ""temperature"" is a fuzzy set that represents the degree of coldness, and ""heater ON"" is a crisp value that represents the action to be taken. The system uses the rule to determine the appropriate action based on the degree of coldness.



Fuzzy logic has been used in a variety of applications, including control systems, artificial intelligence, and decision-making. It is particularly useful in situations where it is difficult to express the relationships between variables precisely, or where there is a large degree of uncertainty or imprecision in the data.",1
human_242,"Default logic is a non-monotonic logic proposed by Raymond Reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions.
Default logic can express facts like “by default, something is true”; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false. This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: “birds typically fly”. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified. Default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions.",0

One of the key features of default logic is that it allows for the introduction of new information that may override or negate a default assumption. This means that default logic can be used to revise and update beliefs as new information becomes available, making it a useful tool for reasoning about the uncertain and changing world.

In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences (cf. defeasible reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence.
Most studied formal logics have a monotonic entailment relation, meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a pruning of its set of conclusions. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. A monotonic logic cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (conclusions may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (conclusions are only deduced as most likely explanations), some important approaches  to reasoning about knowledge (the ignorance of a conclusion must be retracted when the conclusion becomes known), and similarly, belief revision (new  knowledge may contradict old beliefs).",0

These logics are used in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, philosophy, and linguistics, to model reasoning under uncertainty and to handle incomplete or inconsistent information.



In default logic, conclusions are reached by assuming a set of default assumptions to be true unless there is evidence to the contrary. This allows for the possibility of revising conclusions as new information becomes available.



Autoepistemic logic is a type of non-monotonic logic that is used to model reasoning about one's own beliefs. In this logic, conclusions can be revised as new information becomes available, and the process of revising conclusions is based on the principle of belief revision.



Circumscription is a type of non-monotonic logic that is used to model reasoning about incomplete or inconsistent information. In this logic, conclusions are reached by considering only a subset of the available information, with the goal of arriving at the most reasonable conclusion given the limited information.

human_246,"Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic created by John McCarthy to formalize the common sense assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified. Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the frame problem. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented first-order logic  to allow the minimization of the extension of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the closed-world assumption that what is not known to be true is false.
The original problem considered by McCarthy was that of missionaries and cannibals: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank of a river; they have to cross the river using a boat that can only take two, with the additional constraint that cannibals must never outnumber the missionaries on either bank (as otherwise the missionaries would be killed and, presumably, eaten). The problem considered by McCarthy was not that of finding a sequence of steps to reach the goal (the article on the missionaries and cannibals problem contains one such solution), but rather that of excluding conditions that are not explicitly stated. For example, the solution ""go half a mile south and cross the river on the bridge"" is intuitively not valid because the statement of the problem does not mention such a bridge. On the other hand, the existence of this bridge is not excluded by the statement of the problem either. That the bridge does not exist is
a consequence of the implicit assumption that the statement of the problem contains everything that is relevant to its solution. Explicitly stating that a bridge does not exist is not a solution to this problem, as there are many other exceptional conditions that should be excluded (such as the presence of a rope for fastening the cannibals, the presence of a larger boat nearby, etc.)
Circumscription was later used by McCarthy to formalize the implicit assumption of inertia: things do not change unless otherwise specified.  Circumscription seemed to be useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; this is known as the frame problem. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the Yale shooting problem scenario. Other solutions to the frame problem that correctly formalize the Yale shooting problem exist; some use circumscription but in a different way.",0
ai_247,"In logic and artificial intelligence, circumscription is a method of reasoning that allows one to reason about a set of possible worlds by considering the minimal set of assumptions that would make a given formula true in that set of worlds. It was first proposed by John McCarthy in his paper ""Circumscription - A Form of Non-Monotonic Reasoning"" in 1980.



Circumscription can be seen as a way of representing incomplete or uncertain knowledge. It allows one to reason about a set of possible worlds without having to enumerate all of the details of those worlds. Instead, one can reason about the set of possible worlds by considering the minimal set of assumptions that would make a given formula true in those worlds.



For example, suppose we want to reason about a set of possible worlds in which there is a unique individual who is a spy. We might represent this using circumscription by stating that there is a unique individual who is a spy and that this individual is not a member of any other group or class. This allows us to reason about the set of possible worlds in which there is a unique spy without having to enumerate all of the details of those worlds.



Circumscription has been applied in various areas of artificial intelligence, including knowledge representation, natural language processing, and automated reasoning. It has also been used in the study of non-monotonic reasoning, which is the ability to reason about a set of possible worlds in the presence of incomplete or uncertain information.",1
human_248,"Description logics (DL) are a family of formal knowledge representation languages. Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than first-order logic.

There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.
DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge).

In DL, a concept is represented by a set of individuals (also called ""instances"") that have a certain set of properties.

DLs also allow the definition of complex concepts using logical operators, such as ""and"", ""or"", and ""not"". For example, the concept ""small dog"" might be defined as a dog that is both small and weighs less than 20 pounds.



DLs also allow the definition of relationships between concepts. For example, the relationship ""is a parent of"" might be defined between the concepts ""person"" and ""child"". This allows DLs to represent hierarchical relationships between concepts, such as the fact that a ""poodle"" is a type of ""dog"", which is a type of ""mammal"".

Actions are represented using functions that take a situation as input and produce a new situation as output. For example, an action might be represented as a function that takes a situation where the cat is on the mat and produces a new situation where the cat is no longer on the mat.



Reasoning in situation calculus involves making inferences about what will happen as a result of performing different actions in different situations. This can be done using logical rules that describe how actions affect the state of the world and the objects within it.

It is based on the idea that events can be described in terms of their preconditions, effects, and duration, and that these events can interact and cause changes in the state of the domain.



In event calculus, events are represented as logical formulas that contain variables, constants, and predicates. Preconditions specify the conditions that must be satisfied for an event to occur, effects specify the changes that an event causes to the state of the domain, and duration specifies the length of time that an event lasts. The event calculus includes a set of rules for reasoning about events, including rules for determining when events can occur, the order in which they occur, and the effects they have on the domain.

ai_257,"Paraconsistent logic is a type of logical system that allows for the existence of contradictions within a set of statements or beliefs. In classical logic, a contradiction is considered to be a logical impossibility, and any statement that contradicts another statement must be false. In paraconsistent logic, however, contradictions are not necessarily false, and it is possible for a statement to be both true and false at the same time.



Paraconsistent logic was developed as a way to better represent the complexities of natural language and the way that people often reason and argue. It has been applied in a variety of fields, including philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.



One of the key principles of paraconsistent logic is the idea that contradictory statements can coexist without canceling each other out. This is in contrast to classical logic, which holds that a contradiction must always be false. In paraconsistent logic, a statement can be considered true within a certain context, even if it contradicts another statement that is also considered true within that same context.



There are various approaches to paraconsistent logic, and different logicians have developed different systems and principles for dealing with contradictions. Some of the most well-known approaches include dialetheism, which holds that some contradictions are true, and supervaluationism, which allows for the existence of multiple conflicting statements without requiring them to be true or false.",1

human_265,"For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary developers of its theory.
This digital filter is sometimes termed the Stratonovich–Kalman–Bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general, nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the Soviet mathematician Ruslan Stratonovich. In fact, some of the special case linear filter's equations appeared in  papers by Stratonovich that were published before summer 1960, when Kalman met with Stratonovich during a conference in Moscow.
Kalman filtering has numerous technological applications. A common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly aircraft, spacecraft and ships positioned dynamically. Furthermore, Kalman filtering is a concept much applied in time series analysis used for topics such as signal processing and econometrics. Kalman filtering is also one of the main topics of robotic motion planning and control and can be used for trajectory optimization.[10] Kalman filtering also works for modeling the central nervous system's control of movement. Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback, the use of Kalman filters[11] provides a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of a motor system and issuing updated commands.[12]
The algorithm works by a two-phase process. For the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.
Optimality of Kalman filtering assumes that errors have a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  In the words of Rudolf E. Kálmán: ""In summary, the following assumptions are made about random processes: Physical random phenomena may be thought of as due to primary random sources exciting dynamic systems. The primary sources are assumed to be independent gaussian random processes with zero mean; the dynamic systems will be linear.""[13]  Though regardless of Gaussianity, if the process and measurement covariances are known, the Kalman filter is the best possible linear estimator in the minimum mean-square-error sense.[14]
Extensions and generalizations of the method have also been developed, such as the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The basis is a hidden Markov model such that the state space of the latent variables is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions. Kalman filtering has been used successfully in multi-sensor fusion,[15] and distributed sensor networks to develop distributed or consensus Kalman filtering.[16]",0
ai_266,"The Kalman filter is a mathematical method used to estimate the state of a system from noisy and incomplete observations. It is often used in the fields of engineering, economics, and computer science for tasks such as signal processing, sensor fusion, and state estimation.



The Kalman filter is based on the idea of recursive Bayesian filtering, which involves repeatedly updating the probability distribution over the state of the system based on new observations and process model. It works by combining an initial estimate of the state of the system with additional information from noisy observations to produce a more accurate estimate.



The Kalman filter involves two steps: prediction and correction. In the prediction step, the filter uses a process model to predict the state of the system at the next time step based on the current estimate and any additional control inputs. In the correction step, the filter updates the estimate based on new observations, using a measurement model to relate the observations to the state of the system.



The Kalman filter can be used for both linear and nonlinear systems, and it is often used in applications where the system being modeled is uncertain or the observations are noisy. It is also widely used in control systems, robotics, and navigation, where it can be used to estimate the state of a system and track its position and velocity over time.",1

ai_272,"A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. It is used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system, in which the current state of the system depends on both the actions taken by the decision maker and the probabilistic outcomes of those actions.



In an MDP, a decision maker (also known as an agent) takes actions in a series of discrete time steps, transitioning the system from one state to another. At each time step, the agent receives a reward based on the current state and action taken, and the reward influences the agent's future decisions.



MDPs are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve problems involving sequential decision making, such as controlling a robot or deciding which investments to make. They are also used in operations research and economics to model and analyze systems with uncertain outcomes.



An MDP is defined by a set of states, a set of actions, and a transition function that describes the probabilistic outcomes of taking a given action in a given state. The goal in an MDP is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time, given the transition probabilities and rewards for each state and action.

Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).
Often, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously as explanatory variables or features.  These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. ""A"", ""B"", ""AB"" or ""O"", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. ""large"", ""medium"" or ""small""), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Other classifiers work by comparing observations to previous observations by means of a similarity or distance function.
An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier.  The term ""classifier"" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.
Terminology across fields is quite varied. In statistics, where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of observations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables, regressors, etc.), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes, which are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable.  In machine learning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory variables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible categories to be predicted are classes.

In statistical modeling and data analysis, classifiers can be used to identify patterns or trends in data, or to make predictions about future outcomes based on past data. For example, a classifier might be used to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase based on their past shopping history, or to identify potential fraudulent activity in a dataset of financial transactions.

Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations (if any) of a pattern within a token sequence, to output some component of the matched pattern, and to substitute the matching pattern with some other token sequence (i.e., search and replace).
Sequence patterns (e.g., a text string) are often described using regular expressions and matched using techniques such as backtracking.
Tree patterns are used in some programming languages as a general tool to process data based on its structure, e.g. C#, F#, Haskell, ML, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift and the symbolic mathematics language Mathematica have special syntax for expressing tree patterns and a language construct for conditional execution and value retrieval based on it.

A decision tree consists of a root node, branches, and leaf nodes. The root node represents the overall decision to be made, and the branches represent the possible outcomes of that decision. The leaf nodes represent the final decision or predicted outcome. Each internal node of the tree represents a ""test"" on an attribute, and each branch represents the outcome of the test. The tree is created by analyzing the data and determining which attributes are the most important for making the prediction.



To create a decision tree, the algorithm starts at the root node and divides the data into subsets based on the most important attribute. It then repeats this process for each subset until it reaches a leaf node, which represents a predicted outcome. The decision tree is built in a top-down, greedy manner, meaning it selects the best attribute at each step without considering the overall impact on the final decision.

It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:
k-NN is a type of classification where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, if the features represent different physical units or come in vastly different scales then normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically.
Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.
The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.

For classification, the KNN algorithm works as follows:



Choose the number of neighbors, k, and a distance metric.

Find the k nearest neighbors of the data point to be classified.

Among these k neighbors, count the number of data points in each class.

Assign the class with the most data points to the data point to be classified.

For regression, the KNN algorithm works similarly, but instead of classifying the data point based on the majority vote of its neighbors, it calculates the mean of the values of its k nearest neighbors.



The KNN algorithm is simple and easy to implement, but it can be computationally expensive and may not perform well on large datasets. It is also sensitive to the choice of the distance metric and the value of k. However, it can be a good choice for classification and regression problems with small or medium-sized datasets, or for problems where it is important to be able to interpret and understand the model.",1
human_283,"In machine learning, kernel machines are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support-vector machine (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over all pairs of data points computed using Inner products. The feature map in kernel machines is infinite dimensional but only requires a finite dimensional matrix from user-input according to the Representer theorem. Kernel machines are slow to compute for datasets larger than a couple of thousand examples without parallel processing. 
Kernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.  This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates.  This approach is called the ""kernel trick"". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors.
Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support-vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others.
Most kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded. Typically, their statistical properties are analyzed using statistical learning theory (for example, using Rademacher complexity).",0
ai_284,"Kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis and machine learning that operate by mapping data points from a low-dimensional input space to a higher-dimensional feature space, where they become more linearly separable. They do this by using a kernel function, which is a mathematical operation that takes in two input data points and returns a scalar value that represents their similarity.



One of the key advantages of kernel methods is that they can be used to classify data that is not linearly separable in the original input space. By mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space, it becomes possible to find a linear separation between the classes. This is particularly useful for tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, where the data may not be linearly separable in the raw input space.



Some common examples of kernel methods include support vector machines (SVMs), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and kernel ridge regression. These algorithms all make use of a kernel function to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it becomes more tractable to perform various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, or clustering.



Overall, kernel methods are a powerful tool for pattern analysis and machine learning, and have been widely used in a variety of applications including data classification, dimensionality reduction, and function approximation.",1
human_285,"In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
When data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed]",0
ai_286,"Support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The goal of an SVM is to find the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the data points of different classes.



In the case of classification, the algorithm looks for a decision boundary that clearly distinguishes between the different classes. Once the boundary is found, new data points can be easily classified based on which side of the boundary they fall on.



In the case of regression, the algorithm tries to find the hyperplane that best fits the data.



One of the key features of SVMs is that they can handle high-dimensional data efficiently, and can work well even when the number of dimensions is much greater than the number of samples. This makes them particularly useful in situations where there are a lot of features and not a lot of data.



Another important feature of SVMs is that they can handle data that is not linearly separable by using a kernel function, which maps the data into a higher-dimensional space in which it becomes linearly separable.



SVMs have been widely used in a variety of applications, including text classification, image classification, and bioinformatics.",1
human_287,"In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple ""probabilistic classifiers"" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels.
Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression,: 718  which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.
In the statistics literature, naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes. All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method.",0
ai_288,"The Naive Bayes classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It is based on the idea of using Bayes' theorem, which is a statistical formula that describes the probability of an event occurring given certain conditions.



In the context of classification, the Naive Bayes classifier is used to predict the class or category of a given sample based on certain features or attributes. It makes the assumption that all of the features or attributes are independent of each other, which is why it is called ""naive."" This assumption allows the algorithm to make predictions more quickly and efficiently, but it may not always be accurate.



The Naive Bayes classifier is often used in natural language processing and spam filtering, as well as other applications where the features are independent of each other. It is a simple and effective algorithm that is easy to implement and can work well with large datasets. However, it may not always perform as well as other more complex algorithms on certain types of data.",1
human_289,"Hebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:
The theory is often summarized as ""Cells that fire together wire together."" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to ""take part in firing"" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.
The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.",0
ai_290,"Hebbian learning is a type of learning that occurs in the brain and is named after the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb. It is based on the idea that neurons that fire together wire together, meaning that the connection between two neurons becomes stronger when they are active at the same time. This is believed to be one of the ways that the brain learns and adapts to new information.



In Hebbian learning, the strength of the connection between two neurons is increased when they are activated simultaneously. This leads to the formation of new neural pathways, which can then be used to store and process information. Hebbian learning is thought to play a role in a variety of cognitive processes, including learning, memory, and decision making.



Hebbian learning is different from other types of learning, such as classical conditioning or reinforcement learning, in that it does not rely on the reinforcement of specific behaviors or the association of stimuli with particular outcomes. Instead, it is based on the idea that the brain changes in response to experience and that these changes can be permanent.",1
human_291,"In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.
Gradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.",0
ai_292,"Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients and biases) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function.



In machine learning, we often want to find the parameters that minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. The cost function quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual output and the goal of the optimization is to find the values of the parameters that minimize this difference, or cost.



The gradient descent algorithm works by starting with initial guesses for the parameters and then iteratively adjusting them to reduce the cost. At each step, the algorithm computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient is a vector that indicates the direction of steepest descent. The algorithm then updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, since this will reduce the cost. This process is repeated until the cost function is minimized or until a predefined number of iterations is reached.



There are several variations of the gradient descent algorithm, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. The choice of which variant to use depends on the specific problem and the available computational resources.",1
human_293,"Competitive learning is a form of unsupervised learning in artificial neural networks, in which nodes compete for the right to respond to a subset of the input data. A variant of Hebbian learning, competitive learning works by increasing the specialization of each node in the network.  It is well suited to finding clusters within data.
Models and algorithms based on the principle of competitive learning include vector quantization and self-organizing maps (Kohonen maps).",0
ai_294,"Competitive learning is a type of learning rule used in artificial neural networks that involves training a network to classify inputs by adjusting the weights of the connections between the neurons in the network. In competitive learning, the neurons in the network compete with each other to classify the input. This is typically done by having each neuron in the network receive input from the previous layer, and then the neuron with the highest activation (i.e., the one that is most strongly activated by the input) wins the competition and is allowed to pass its activation to the next layer of the network. The weights of the connections between the neurons are adjusted in order to optimize the network's ability to classify the input.



Competitive learning is often used in self-organizing maps, which are neural networks that are trained to project high-dimensional input data onto a lower-dimensional output space in a way that preserves the topological structure of the data. This allows the network to learn to cluster the data and classify it based on its topological relationships.



Overall, competitive learning is a useful tool for training artificial neural networks to classify inputs, and it is often used in combination with other learning algorithms in order to improve the performance of the network.",1

The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.",0
ai_296,"A feedforward neural network is a type of artificial neural network that is used for classification and prediction tasks. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected ""neurons,"" which process and transmit information. Each layer receives input from the previous layer, processes it, and passes it on to the next layer. The output of the final layer is the network's prediction or classification of the input data.



The first layer of a feedforward neural network is called the input layer, and it consists of neurons that receive the input data. The middle layers are called hidden layers, and they process the input data using weights and biases. The final layer is called the output layer, and it produces the network's prediction or classification.



Feedforward neural networks are called ""feedforward"" because the information flows through the network in only one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without looping back. This is in contrast to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, which can process information in a loop.



Feedforward neural networks are widely used in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. They are a powerful tool for solving complex problems, and they have been instrumental in the development of many modern artificial intelligence systems.",1

Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as ""vanilla"" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.
An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.",0

The input layer receives the input data, the hidden layers process the data, and the output layer produces the output.



MLPs are used for a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and function approximation. They are particularly well-suited for tasks that require complex decision boundaries, such as recognizing handwritten digits or classifying images.



MLPs are trained using a variant of the backpropagation algorithm, which involves adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons in order to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. The weights are adjusted iteratively, using a process called gradient descent, until the error is minimized.



One of the key features of MLPs is that they are fully connected, meaning that every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. This allows them to model complex relationships between the input and output data. However, this also means that MLPs can require a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.",1

RBFs are typically used in the hidden layer of an RBF network, and the output layer consists of a linear combination of the outputs of the hidden layer.



RBF networks are useful for approximating functions and mapping input data to output data. They are particularly well-suited for classification tasks, where the goal is to assign an input to one of a finite number of classes. RBF networks can also be used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous output value given an input.



RBF networks have several advantages, including their ability to handle complex, nonlinear relationships between input and output data, and their ability to generalize well to unseen data.

human_307,"The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms.
Complexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.
A sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body. For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.
The term receptive field was first used by Sherrington in 1906 to describe the area of skin from which a scratch reflex could be elicited in a dog. In 1938, Hartline started to apply the term to single neurons, this time from the frog retina.
This concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field for a cell in the brain. This process is called convergence.
Receptive fields have been used in modern artificial deep neural networks that work with local operations.",0

For example, in a convolutional neural network (CNN), the receptive field of a neuron in the first convolutional layer is determined by the size and stride of the convolutional kernel being applied at that layer. As the input image is passed through the network and the kernels are applied, the receptive field of each neuron grows larger, as it is receiving information from a larger region of the input image.



The size and shape of the receptive field can have a significant impact on the performance of a neural network, as it determines the context that the neuron is able to consider when making a prediction. A larger receptive field allows a neuron to consider more context from the input image, which can be beneficial for tasks such as object recognition, where it is important to consider the relationships between different parts of the image. However, a larger receptive field also requires more computation and can make the network more prone to overfitting, so it is important to balance the size of the receptive field with the needs of the task at hand.",1
human_309,"Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
Originally specified in 1960, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket and Clojure.
Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by (though not originally derived from) the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became a favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research.[10] As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler,[11] and the read–eval–print loop.[12]
The name LISP derives from ""LISt Processor"".[13] Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.
The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s-expressions, or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would be called as (f arg1 arg2 arg3).",0

This makes it easy to manipulate code using the same constructs that are used to manipulate data, and it also allows Lisp programs to be very concise and expressive.

In the brain, neurons and synapses work together to process and transmit information. Neuromorphic computing systems aim to replicate this process using artificial neurons and synapses, often implemented using specialized hardware. This hardware can take a variety of forms, including electronic circuits, photonics, or even mechanical systems.



One of the key features of neuromorphic computing systems is their ability to process and transmit information in a highly parallel and distributed manner. This allows them to perform certain tasks much more efficiently than traditional computers, which are based on sequential processing.



Neuromorphic computing has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications, including machine learning, pattern recognition, and decision making. It may also have important implications for fields such as neuroscience, where it could provide new insights into how the brain works.",1
human_315,"A search engine is a software system designed to carry out web searches.  They search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). When a user enters a query into a search engine, the engine scans its index of web pages to find those that are relevant to the user's query. The results are then ranked by relevancy and displayed to the user. The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories and social bookmarking sites, which are maintained by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler. Any internet-based content that can't be indexed and searched by a web search engine falls under the category of deep web.",0

human_317,"Targeted advertising is a form of advertising, including online advertising, that is directed towards an audience with certain traits, based on the product or person the advertiser is promoting. These traits can either be demographic with a focus on race, economic status, sex, age, generation, level of education, income level, and employment, or psychographic focused on the consumer values, personality, attitude, opinion, lifestyle and interest. This focus can also entail behavioral variables, such as browser history, purchase history, and other recent online activities. The process of algorithm targeting eliminates waste.
Traditional forms of advertising, including billboards, newspapers, magazines, and radio channels, are progressively becoming replaced by online advertisements. The Information and communication technology (ICT) space has transformed recently, resulting in targeted advertising stretching across all ICT technologies, such as web, IPTV, and mobile environments. In the next generation's advertising, the importance of targeted advertisements will radically increase, as it spreads across numerous ICT channels cohesively.
Through the emergence of new online channels, the usefulness of targeted advertising is increasing because companies aim to minimize wasted advertising by means of information technology. Most targeted new media advertising currently uses second-order proxies for targets, such as tracking online or mobile web activities of consumers, associating historical web page consumer demographics with new consumer web page access, using a search word as the basis of implied interest, or contextual advertising.",0
ai_318,"Targeted advertising is a form of advertising that is customized to a specific group of individuals or a specific target audience. It is designed to reach consumers who are more likely to be interested in a particular product or service, based on their demographics, interests, and online behavior.



To deliver targeted advertising, companies use data and analytics to identify and segment their target audience. This data can come from a variety of sources, such as customer databases, social media profiles, and website analytics. With this information, advertisers can create targeted ads that are more relevant and appealing to their intended audience, increasing the chances of conversion.



Targeted advertising can be delivered through various channels, such as search engines, social media platforms, and websites. It can take the form of banner ads, sponsored posts, or personalized emails.



One benefit of targeted advertising is that it can be more effective at reaching and engaging the right audience, compared to traditional, untargeted advertising methods. It can also help to reduce the cost of advertising, as it allows companies to focus their efforts and resources on a specific group of consumers rather than trying to reach a broad, undefined audience. However, it is important for companies to be transparent and respectful of consumer privacy when collecting and using data for targeted advertising.",1

This data can include a variety of things, such as emails, web pages, video and audio files, and other types of information that are transmitted between devices connected to the internet. Internet traffic is measured in a variety of ways, including by the number of bits or bytes transmitted per second, the number of packets transmitted, or the number of connections made to a particular website or service.



There are many factors that can affect the amount of internet traffic at a given time, including the number of people using the internet, the type of content being accessed, and the time of day. Internet traffic tends to be highest during peak hours, when many people are using the internet at the same time, and it tends to be lower during off-peak hours.



Understanding internet traffic can be important for a variety of reasons. For example, internet service providers may need to manage their networks to ensure that they can handle the amount of traffic being transmitted at a given time, and website owners may need to optimize their sites to ensure that they can handle the traffic they receive. Additionally, understanding internet traffic patterns can help businesses and organizations better understand how people are using the internet and how they can better reach and engage with their target audience online.",1
human_321,"Vehicular automation involves the use of mechatronics, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems to assist the operator of a vehicle (car, aircraft, watercraft, or otherwise). These features and the vehicles employing them may be labeled as intelligent or smart. A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation, to ease but not entirely replace human input, may be referred to as semi-autonomous, whereas a vehicle relying solely on automation is called robotic or autonomous. Both of these types are instantiated in today's various self-driving cars, unmanned surface vehicles, autonomous trains, advanced airliner autopilots, drone aircraft, and planetary rovers, as well as guided rockets and missiles. After the invention of the integrated circuit, the sophistication of automation technology increased. Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated functions to automobiles and other vehicles. The technology involved in implementing autonomous vehicles is very expansive, ranging from technological improvements in the vehicle itself to the environment and objects around the vehicle. As the use of automated vehicles increases, they are becoming more influential in human lives. Although automated vehicles bring various benefits, they also come with various concerns.

Autonomous vehicles can be classified based on their level of automation, with levels ranging from fully autonomous (level 5) to partially autonomous (levels 1-4).



Fully autonomous vehicles are designed to be able to operate without any human input, while partially autonomous vehicles require some level of human intervention or supervision. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation and change the way we live and work, as they could potentially reduce the number of accidents caused by human error and make transportation more efficient and convenient. However, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, and their deployment will likely be gradual as the technology continues to mature.",1

Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles.[10][11]
Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields. 
Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016).[13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.
As of December 2022[update], vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell a legally approved Level 3 car.[14][15][16] Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[17] In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car.[18] In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.[19]

human_329,"Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of June 2022[update], is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.
Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.
As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as ""Wintel""). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching ""Think different"" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing.

human_331,"Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad Pro. The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, accessing sensitive data, providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji, as well as six degrees of freedom (6DOF) head-tracking, eye-tracking, and other features. Initially released in November 2017 with the iPhone X, it has since been updated and introduced to several new iPhone models, and all iPad Pro models.
The Face ID hardware consists of a sensor with three modules; a dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user's face, a module called the flood illuminator that shines infrared light at the face, and an infrared camera which takes an infrared picture of the user, reads the resulting pattern and generates a 3D facial map. This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem, and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently. The system can recognize faces with glasses, clothing, makeup, and facial hair, and adapts to changes in appearance over time.
Face ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy. Apple claims that Face ID is statistically more advanced than Touch ID fingerprint scanning. It exhibits significantly fewer false positives. Still, Face ID has shown issues at separating identical twins. Multiple security features largely limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks, and only one proof-of-concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded. Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States. Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third-party app developers' access to ""rough maps"" of user facial data, despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data.
On some devices, Face ID is unable to recognize users wearing face masks. Apple responded to criticism by offering faster fallback to passcode input, and the option for Apple Watch users to confirm whether they intended to unlock their iPhone. In March 2022, Apple released iOS 15.4 which adds mask-compatible Face ID for iPhone 12 and later devices.",0

Spam emails, also known as junk mail, are typically sent in large quantities by advertisers and marketers for the purpose of promoting their products or services. These emails can be a nuisance and can clog up a user's inbox, making it difficult to find important messages.



Spam filters work by analyzing the content of incoming emails and identifying characteristics that are commonly associated with spam. For example, spam emails often contain certain words or phrases that are commonly used by spammers, such as ""free money"" or ""double your income."" They may also contain links to suspicious websites or attachments that could potentially contain malware.



There are several different techniques that can be used to filter spam, including rules-based filtering, machine learning algorithms, and collaborative filtering. Rules-based filtering involves creating a set of rules or criteria that an email must meet in order to be considered spam. Machine learning algorithms are able to learn from examples of spam and non-spam emails and use this knowledge to identify new spam emails. Collaborative filtering involves analyzing the behavior of a group of users and using this information to identify spam emails.



Spam filtering is an important tool for helping users manage their email inboxes and protect their computers from potential threats. It is an ongoing process, as spammers continually find new ways to bypass filters and send unwanted emails.",1

Kasparov also holds records for the most consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).
Kasparov became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association. In 1997 he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls when he lost to the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicized match. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Despite losing the title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world's highest-rated player when he retired from professional chess in 2005.
Since retiring, he devoted his time to politics and writing. He formed the United Civil Front movement and joined as a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year's Russian presidential race, but after encountering logistical problems in his campaign, for which he blamed ""official obstruction"", he withdrew.

He is the highest-earning American game show contestant, having won money on five different game shows, including $4,522,700 on the U.S. game show Jeopardy! which he currently hosts, sharing duties with Mayim Bialik.
He holds the record for the longest winning streak on Jeopardy! with 74 consecutive wins. He also holds the record for the highest average correct responses per game in Jeopardy! history (for those contestants with at least 300 correct responses) with 35.9 during his original run (no other contestant has exceeded 30) and 33.1 overall, including tournaments and special events. In 2004, he won 74 consecutive Jeopardy! games before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg on his 75th appearance. His total earnings on Jeopardy! are $4,522,700, consisting of: $2,520,700 over his 74 wins; a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance; a $500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions (2005); a $300,000 second-place prize in Jeopardy!'s IBM Challenge (2011), when he lost to the Watson computer but became the first person to beat third-place finisher Brad Rutter; a $100,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades (2014); a $100,000 second-place prize (his share of his team's $300,000 prize) in the Jeopardy! All-Star Games (2019); and a $1 million first-place prize in the Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time (2020).
During his first run of Jeopardy! appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings. His total was surpassed by Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions, adding $2 million to Rutter's existing Jeopardy! winnings. Jennings regained the record after appearing on several other game shows, culminating with his results on an October 2008 appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, though Rutter retained the record for highest Jeopardy! winnings and once again passed Jennings' total after his victory in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament. In 2020, he once again faced off with and won against Rutter, as well as James Holzhauer, in a special primetime series, Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time.
After his success on Jeopardy!, Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006. In September 2020, he signed on as a consulting producer of Jeopardy!, a job that will include an on-air role reading categories. He held this role until the start of the show's thirty-ninth season.
Following Alex Trebek's death on November 8, 2020, Jennings hosted Jeopardy! as the first of a series of guest hosts. His episodes aired from January 11, 2021, to February 19, 2021. Following Mike Richards' exit early in the 2021–22 season, Jennings and Mayim Bialik were both named hosts; Jennings’ hosting duties are exclusive to the daily syndicated series (Bialik hosts syndicated series episodes as well as primetime network specials).[10] Jennings will continue to split hosting duties with Bialik for the 39th season of the series.[11][12]",0

human_350,"Computer Go is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to creating a computer program that plays the traditional board game Go.  The field is sharply divided into two eras.  Before 2015, the programs of the era were weak.  The best efforts of the 1980s and 1990s produced only AIs that could be defeated by beginners, and AIs of the early 2000s were intermediate level at best.  Professionals could defeat these programs even given handicaps of 10+ stones in favor of the AI.  Many of the algorithms such as alpha-beta minimax that performed well as AIs for checkers and chess fell apart on Go's 19x19 board, as there were too many branching possibilities to consider.  Creation of a human professional quality program with the techniques and hardware of the time was out of reach.  Some AI researchers speculated that the problem was unsolvable without creation of human-like AI.
The application of Monte Carlo tree search to Go algorithms provided a notable improvement in the late 2000s decade, with programs finally able to achieve a low-dan level: that of an advanced amateur.  High-dan amateurs and professionals could still exploit these programs' weaknesses and win consistently, but computer performance had advanced past the intermediate (single-digit kyu) level.  The tantalizing unmet goal of defeating the best human players without a handicap, long thought unreachable, brought a burst of renewed interest.  The key insight proved to be an application of machine learning and deep learning.  DeepMind, a Google acquisition dedicated to AI research, produced AlphaGo in 2015 and announced it to the world in 2016.  AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, a 9 dan professional, in a no-handicap match in 2016, then defeated Ke Jie in 2017, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.  Just as checkers had fallen to machines in 1995 and chess in 1997, computer programs finally conquered humanity's greatest Go champions in 2016–2017.  DeepMind did not release AlphaGo for public use, but various programs have been built since based on the journal articles DeepMind released describing AlphaGo and its variants.",0
ai_351,"Computer Go is a game that involves computer programs that play the board game Go. Go is an ancient board game that originated in China and is played on a grid of 19x19 intersections. The objective of the game is to surround more territory on the board than your opponent. The game is known for its simple rules and deep strategic complexity.



Computer Go is a challenging problem for artificial intelligence because it involves complex strategic thinking, long-term planning, and the ability to evaluate positions based on incomplete information. Developing effective algorithms for Computer Go requires a combination of techniques from artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, search, and pattern recognition.



Computer Go has made significant progress in recent years, and the best computer programs are now able to beat the strongest human players. However, the game remains a challenging problem for artificial intelligence, and there is still much work to be done to improve the capabilities of Computer Go programs.",1
ai_352,"In the game of Go, handicaps are used to level the playing field between players of different skill levels. Handicaps are given to the weaker player in the form of extra stones placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The number of handicap stones is determined by the difference in rank between the two players.



For example, if one player is two ranks higher than the other, the weaker player may be given a two-stone handicap. This means that the weaker player will place two stones on the board at predetermined positions before the stronger player makes the first move. The stronger player then plays as usual, but must consider the additional stones placed on the board as part of the weaker player's strategy.



Handicaps are used in Go to make the game more competitive and enjoyable for both players, as it allows players of different skill levels to play against each other without one player having a significant advantage.",1
human_353,"In economics, perfect information (sometimes referred to as ""no hidden information"") is a feature of perfect competition. With perfect information in a market, all consumers and producers have complete and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions.
In game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the ""initialization event"" of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game).
Perfect information is importantly different from complete information, which implies common knowledge of each player's utility functions, payoffs, strategies and ""types"". A game with perfect information may or may not have complete information.
Games where some aspect of play is hidden from opponents - such as the cards in poker and bridge - are examples of games with imperfect information.",0
ai_354,"Imperfect information refers to a situation in which one or more players in a game or decision-making process do not have complete information about the options available to them or the consequences of their actions. In other words, the players do not have a complete understanding of the situation and must make decisions based on incomplete or limited information.



This can occur in various settings, such as in strategic games, economics, and even in everyday life. For example, in a game of poker, players do not know what cards the other players have and must make decisions based on the cards they can see and the actions of the other players. In the stock market, investors do not have complete information about the future performance of a company and must make investment decisions based on incomplete data. In everyday life, we often have to make decisions without having complete information about all of the potential outcomes or the preferences of the other people involved.



Imperfect information can lead to uncertainty and complexity in decision-making processes and can have significant impacts on the outcomes of games and real-world situations. It is an important concept in game theory, economics, and other fields that study decision-making under uncertainty.",1
human_355,"The Atari 2600, initially branded as the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS) from its release until November 1982, is a home video game console developed and produced by Atari, Inc. Released in September 1977, it popularized microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge—initially Combat and later Pac-Man.
Atari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as codename Stella by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976.
The Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first killer app was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983–84, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Activision's Pitfall!.
In 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system in North America. Amid competition from both new consoles and game developers, a number of poor decisions from Atari management affected the company and the industry as a whole. The most public was an extreme investment into licensed games for the 2600, including Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the system's biggest selling game, but the conversion's poor quality eroded consumer confidence in the console. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was critically panned and a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market. Atari's downfall reverberated through the industry resulting in the video game crash of 1983.
Warner sold Atari's home division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in 1984. In 1986, the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backward-compatible Atari 7800, but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Production of the Atari 2600 ended on January 1, 1992, with an estimated 30 million units sold across its lifetime.",0

The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. 
A team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020. The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group. It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.

Smart traffic lights use sensors to detect the presence and movement of vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles at intersections. They can use this information to adjust the timing of green lights based on the volume of traffic, the speed of vehicles, and other factors. For example, if a road has heavy traffic and there are many cars waiting at a red light, the smart traffic light may extend the duration of the green light to allow more vehicles to pass through the intersection.



Smart traffic lights can also communicate with other traffic lights and with vehicles on the road using technologies such as dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), which is a wireless communication standard used for transportation. This allows the traffic lights to coordinate with each other and with vehicles to optimize traffic flow and improve safety.

Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not in origins), relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as ""a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes.

human_371,"The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.
The test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: ""I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"" Because ""thinking"" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to ""replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the ""imitation game"", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: ""Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?"" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that ""machines can think"".

ai_372,"The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. It is named after Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist who proposed the test in 1950.



The test is conducted by having a human judge engage in natural language conversations with another human and with a machine, and then deciding which of the two they are communicating with. If the judge cannot reliably tell which is the machine and which is the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.



The Turing Test is often used as a benchmark for determining whether a machine exhibits artificial intelligence, although it is not a perfect measure. Some critics argue that the test is too limited in scope, as it only measures a machine's ability to mimic human conversation and does not take into account other forms of intelligent behavior. Others argue that the test is too subjective, as it relies on the judgments of individual human judges. Despite these criticisms, the Turing Test remains a widely recognized and influential concept in the field of artificial intelligence.",1

human_377,"Neat and scruffy are two contrasting approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) research. The distinction was made in the 70s and was a subject of discussion until the middle 80s. In the 1990s and 21st century AI research adopted ""neat"" approaches almost exclusively and these have proven to be the most successful.
""Neats"" use algorithms based on formal paradigms such as logic, mathematical optimization or neural networks. Neat researchers and analysts have expressed the hope that a single formal paradigm can be extended and improved to achieve general intelligence and superintelligence. 
""Scruffies"" use any number of different algorithms and methods to achieve intelligent behavior. Scruffy programs may require large amounts of hand coding or knowledge engineering. Scruffies have argued that the general intelligence can only be implemented by solving a large number of essentially unrelated problems, and that there is no magic bullet that will allow programs to develop general intelligence autonomously. 
The neat approach is similar to physics, in that it uses simple mathematical models as its foundation. The scruffy approach is more like biology, where much of the work involves studying and categorizing diverse phenomena.[a]",0
ai_378,"""Neats and scruffies"" is a term used to describe two contrasting approaches to research and theorizing in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The term was coined by Herbert Simon and Allen Newell, two pioneering researchers in the field of AI, in a paper published in 1972.



The ""neats"" are those who approach AI research with a focus on creating rigorous, formal models and methods that can be precisely defined and analyzed. This approach is characterized by a focus on logical rigor and the use of mathematical techniques to analyze and solve problems.



The ""scruffies,"" on the other hand, are those who take a more practical, experimental approach to AI research. This approach is characterized by a focus on creating working systems and technologies that can be used to solve real-world problems, even if they are not as formally defined or rigorously analyzed as the ""neats.""

human_381,"Algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create ""unfair"" outcomes, such as ""privileging"" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.
Bias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect ""systematic and unfair"" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (2021).
As algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.
Algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single ""algorithm"" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.",0
ai_382,"Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic and unfair discrimination that occurs when algorithms and automated systems are used to make decisions that affect people. It can occur when an algorithm is trained on biased data or when the algorithm itself is designed in a biased way. Algorithmic bias can have serious consequences for individuals and society, as it can perpetuate and amplify existing biases and inequalities.



For example, if an algorithm is trained to predict who is likely to default on a loan, and the training data is biased because it disproportionately includes data on people from certain racial or socioeconomic groups who are more likely to default, the algorithm may be biased against those groups. This could result in people from those groups being unfairly denied loans or being offered less favorable terms. Similarly, if an algorithm is designed to screen job applicants and is biased against certain groups, it could result in those groups being unfairly excluded from job opportunities.



It is important to recognize and address algorithmic bias in order to promote fairness and avoid negative consequences for individuals and society. This can involve designing algorithms in an unbiased way, using diverse and representative training data, and implementing safeguards to prevent and mitigate bias in automated decision-making systems.",1
human_383,"Avram Noam Chomsky[a] (born December 7, 1928) is an American public intellectual: a linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian,[b] social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called ""the father of modern linguistics"",[c] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.
An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his anti-war essay ""The Responsibility of Intellectuals"". Becoming associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's list of political opponents. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of unconditional freedom of speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.
One of the most cited scholars alive,[d] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, contemporary state capitalism, U.S. involvement and Israel's role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media.

human_385,"Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.  XAI is relevant even if there is no legal right or regulatory requirement. For example, XAI can improve the user experience of a product or service by helping end users trust that the AI is making good decisions. This way the aim of XAI is to explain what has been done, what is done right now, what will be done next and unveil the information the actions are based on. These characteristics make it possible (i) to confirm existing knowledge (ii) to challenge existing knowledge and (iii) to generate new assumptions.
The algorithms used in AI can be differentiated into white-box and black-box machine learning (ML) algorithms. White-box models are ML models that provide results that are understandable for experts in the domain. Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and can hardly be understood even by domain experts.[10] XAI algorithms are considered to follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability and explainability. Transparency is given “if the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer”.[11] Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans.[12][13][14] Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a joint definition is not yet available.[11] It is suggested that explainability in ML can be considered as “the collection of features of the interpretable domain, that have contributed for a given example to produce a decision (e.g., classification or regression)”.[15] If algorithms meet these requirements, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.[16]
Sometimes it is also possible to achieve a result with high accuracy with a white-box ML algorithm that is interpretable in itself.[17] This is especially important in domains like medicine, defense, finance and law, where it is crucial to understand the decisions and build up trust in the algorithms. Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning, the way forward is symbolic regression, where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset.[18][19][20]
AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command ""maximize accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset"". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as ""reviews containing the word 'horrible' are likely to be negative"". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as ""reviews containing 'Daniel Day-Lewis' are usually positive""; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the train set, or if people consider the rule to be ""cheating"" or ""unfair"". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.[21]",0
ai_386,"Explainable AI, also known as XAI, refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their decision-making processes and predictions.

In contrast to traditional AI systems, which often rely on complex algorithms and machine learning models that are difficult for humans to interpret, XAI aims to make AI more transparent and accountable. This is important because it can help to increase trust in AI systems, as well as improve their effectiveness and efficiency.



There are various approaches to building explainable AI, including using simpler models, introducing human-readable rules or constraints into the AI system, and developing techniques for visualizing and interpreting the inner workings of AI models.

human_387,"A neural network is a network or circuit of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus, a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled in artificial neural networks as weights between nodes. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1.
These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.",0
ai_388,"Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected ""neurons,"" which process and transmit information.



Each neuron receives input from other neurons, performs a computation on those inputs, and produces an output. The output of one layer of neurons becomes the input for the next layer. In this way, information can flow through the network and be transformed and processed at each layer.



Neural networks can be used for a wide range of tasks, including image classification, language translation, and decision making. They are particularly well-suited for tasks that involve complex patterns and relationships in data, as they can learn to recognize these patterns and relationships through training.



Training a neural network involves adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between neurons in order to minimize the error between the predicted output of the network and the true output. This process is typically done using an algorithm called backpropagation, which involves adjusting the weights in a way that reduces the error.



Overall, neural networks are a powerful tool for building intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to new data over time.",1

human_391,"Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of mind, or, as narrow AI, is focused on one narrow task. In John Searle's terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”. Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems.  As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do.  Strong artificial intelligence systems are learning how to run independently of the programmers who programmed them. Weak AI is not able to have a mind of its own, and can only imitate physical behaviors that it can observe. 
It is contrasted with Strong AI, which is defined variously as: 
Scholars like Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak-AI hypothesis (that should not be confused with the ""general"" vs ""narrow"" AI distinction) and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill-posed and problematic since ""artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling""  (p. 85) (as, on the other hand, implied by the strong AI assumption).
AI can be classified as being “… limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.”  Narrow means the robot or computer is strictly limited to only being able to solve one problem at a time. Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

human_393,"Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the ontology and nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. The mind–body problem is a paradigmatic issue in philosophy of mind, although a number of other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness and the nature of particular mental states. Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and its neural correlates, the ontology of the mind, the nature of cognition and of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.
Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly.
Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive physicalist or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.[15] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of sociobiology, computer science (specifically, artificial intelligence), evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences.[16][17][18][19] Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.[20][21][22] Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance, mental properties supervene on physical properties, or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.[23][24] Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues; however, they are far from being resolved.  Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms.[25][26]
However, a number of issues have  been recognized with non-reductive physicalism. First, it is irreconcilable with self-identity over time. Secondly, intentional states of consciousness do not make sense on non-reductive physicalism. Thirdly, free will is impossible to reconcile with either reductive or non-reductive physicalism. Fourthly, it fails to properly explain the phenomenon of mental causation.[27]",0

How do mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and experiences, relate to the physical world?



Philosophers who study the philosophy of mind approach these questions from a variety of perspectives, including metaphysical, epistemological, and scientific. Some philosophers argue that the mind is a purely physical phenomenon that can be fully explained by neuroscience and psychology, while others argue that the mind is a non-physical entity that cannot be reduced to purely physical terms.

Information processing involves various cognitive processes, such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making, which work together to enable us to interact with the world around us. For example, when we see an object, our brain processes visual information about its size, shape, and color, and uses this information to identify the object. When we hear a sound, our brain processes auditory information and uses it to understand what is being said. When we read or write, our brain processes linguistic information and uses it to communicate with others.



Information processing is a key aspect of cognition, which is the mental process by which we acquire, process, store, and use information.

human_399,"In philosophy of mind, qualia (/ˈkwɑːliə/ or /ˈkweɪliə/; singular form: quale) are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.

Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to propositional attitudes, where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing.
Philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett once suggested that qualia was ""an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us"".
Much of the debate over their importance hinges on the definition of the term, and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia. Consequently, the nature and existence of qualia under various definitions remain controversial. While some philosophers of mind like Daniel Dennett argue that qualia do not exist and are incompatible with neuroscience and naturalism, some neuroscientists and neurologists like Gerald Edelman, Antonio Damasio, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch and Rodolfo Llinás state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.[10][11][12][13][14][excessive citations]",0

human_401,"The mind–body problem is a philosophical debate concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. The debate goes beyond addressing the mere question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically. Interactionism arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.
The problem was popularized by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism, and by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, in Avicennian philosophy, and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality as in neutral or substance or essence, in terms of which everything can be explained.
Each of these categories contains numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism, which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and property dualism, which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes; and neutral monism, which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).
Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment. An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism, and is a position that generally characterized post-war Continental philosophy.
The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension (if there is such a thing) has been raised as a criticism of dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.[10] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.[11][12][13][14]
An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model, described in the Buddhist teachings, explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.[15] Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual's mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.[15]",0
ai_402,"The mind-body problem is a philosophical question that asks how the mind and the body are related. It has been a central issue in philosophy for centuries, and it has implications for how we understand the nature of consciousness, the self, and the relationship between the mind and the physical world.



One way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider whether the mind is a distinct entity from the body, or whether it is simply a product of the body's physical processes. This is known as the dualist view. Dualists believe that the mind and the body are separate entities that interact with each other, but are not identical.



Another way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider the mind and the body as two different aspects of the same thing. This is known as monist view. Monists believe that the mind and the body are not separate entities, but rather different ways of looking at the same thing.



There are many different philosophical theories that have been proposed to try to solve the mind-body problem, but it remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion.",1
human_403,"Jerry Alan Fodor (/ˈfoʊdər/; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.
Fodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.
For Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.: 73–75 
Although Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.",0
ai_404,"Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist. He was known for his work on the philosophy of mind, language, and cognitive science. Fodor was born in New York City in 1935 and received his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1956. He went on to earn his PhD from Princeton University in 1960.



Fodor is best known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind, particularly his defense of the idea that the mind is a modular system. This view holds that the mind is composed of a number of independent systems or modules, each of which is specialized for processing a particular type of information. Fodor argued that these modules are innate and dedicated to specific tasks, such as perception, language, and reasoning. He also proposed that mental states are individuated by their causal roles, which he called ""functional roles.""



Fodor was also a leading figure in the development of the theory of computationalism, which holds that the mind is a computational system and that mental processes can be understood in terms of computations. He argued that mental states can be explained in terms of the information that they carry and the operations that they perform on that information.



Fodor's work has had a significant influence on the field of cognitive science and has been widely discussed and debated within the philosophy of mind. He was a professor at Rutgers University and the City University of New York, and was the author of numerous books and articles on the philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

human_405,"Hilary Whitehall Putnam (/ˈpʌtnəm/; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, and computer scientist, and a major figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.
Putnam was known for his willingness to apply equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem.[10] In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.[11]
In philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,[12] later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but ""quasi-empirical"".[13] In epistemology, Putnam is known for his critique of the well-known ""brain in a vat"" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.[14] In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called ""internal realism"",[15] which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.[16]
In his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to ""renew philosophy"" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns.[17] He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]",0

After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he received his PhD in philosophy from Princeton University.



Putnam is best known for his work in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind, in which he argued that mental states and linguistic expressions are not private, subjective entities, but rather are public and objective entities that can be shared and understood by others. He also made significant contributions to the philosophy of science, particularly in the areas of scientific realism and the nature of scientific explanation.



Throughout his career, Putnam was a prolific writer and contributed to a wide range of philosophical debates.

human_407,"John Rogers Searle (/sɜːrl/; born July 31, 1932) is an American philosopher widely noted for contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy. He began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959, and was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley until 2019.
As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Searle was secretary of ""Students against Joseph McCarthy"". He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley's 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court's ""Searle Decision"" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.
In 2000, Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind & Brain Prize. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010. Searle's early work on speech acts, influenced by J.L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the ""Chinese room"" argument against ""strong"" artificial intelligence.
In June 2019, Searle's status as professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, was revoked for his repeated violations of the university's sexual harassment policies.",0

Searle was born in Denver, Colorado in 1932 and received his bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his doctorate from Oxford University. He has taught at the University of California, Berkeley for much of his career and is currently the Slusser Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at that institution.



Searle's work has been influential in the field of philosophy, particularly in the areas of language, mind, and consciousness. He has written extensively on the nature of intentionality, the structure of language, and the relationship between language and thought. In his famous Chinese room argument, he argued that it is impossible for a machine to have genuine understanding or consciousness, as it can only manipulate symbols and has no understanding of their meaning.



Searle has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Jean Nicod Prize, the Erasmus Prize, and the National Humanities Medal. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical Society.",1
human_409,"The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a ""mind,"" ""understanding"" or ""consciousness,""[a] regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, ""Minds, Brains, and Programs"", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle's argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.
The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.""[b]
Although it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research because it does not show a limit in the amount of ""intelligent"" behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.",0
ai_410,"The strong AI hypothesis is the idea that it is possible to create artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior that is equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, human intelligence. This means that a strong AI system would be able to understand and learn about the world in the same way that a human does, and would be able to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn from experience, just like a human.



The strong AI hypothesis is often contrasted with the weak AI hypothesis, which states that AI systems can only be designed to perform specific tasks, and cannot exhibit general intelligence or understand the world in the same way that a human does. While weak AI systems may be able to perform specific tasks very well, they are not capable of adapting to new situations or learning in the same way that a human can.



The strong AI hypothesis has been a subject of much discussion and debate in the field of artificial intelligence and philosophy, and there are differing opinions on whether it is possible to create a strong AI system. Some people believe that it is only a matter of time before strong AI becomes a reality, while others argue that it may never be possible to create a machine that is truly intelligent in the same way that a human is.",1
human_411,"Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient animals have moral worth that is independent of their utility for humans, and that their most basic interests—such as avoiding suffering—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term ""animal rights"" is often used synonymously with ""animal protection"" or ""animal liberation"". More narrowly, ""animal rights"" refers to the idea that many animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as individuals—rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture that may not be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare.
Many advocates for animal rights oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone. This idea, known as speciesism, is considered by them to be a prejudice as irrational as any other. They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, entertainment, or beasts of burden because their status as a different species from humans should not give them different rights from humans. Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as Jainism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto and Animism also espouse some forms of animal rights.
In parallel to the debate about moral rights, law schools in North America now often teach animal law, and several legal scholars, such as Steven M. Wise and Gary L. Francione, support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to non-human animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are hominids. Some animal-rights academics support this because it would break through the species barrier, but others oppose it because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone. As of November 2019[update], 29 countries had enacted bans on hominoid experimentation; Argentina has granted a captive orangutan basic human rights since 2014.
Outside the order of primates, animal-rights discussions most often address the status of mammals (compare charismatic megafauna). Other animals (considered less sentient) have gained less attention; insects relatively little[10]
(outside Jainism), and animal-like bacteria (despite their overwhelming numbers) hardly any.[11] The vast majority of animals have no legally recognised rights.[12]
Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton (1944–2020), who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.[13] Another argument, associated with the utilitarian tradition, maintains that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering;[14] animals may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as ""necessary"" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests can vary considerably.[15] Certain forms of animal-rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and of animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have attracted criticism, including from within the animal-rights movement itself,[16] and have prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of laws, including the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, allowing the prosecution of this sort of activity as terrorism.[17]",0

Animal rights advocates believe that animals have the right to live their lives free from human interference and exploitation, and that they should be allowed to live in a manner that is natural and appropriate for their species. They may also believe that animals have the right to be protected from human activities that could harm them, such as hunting, factory farming, and animal testing.",1
human_413,"The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.
The first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.
The concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.
Some scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.
Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.",0

Some proponents of the intelligence explosion hypothesis argue that such an event could lead to a significant change in the future course of human history, potentially resulting in unprecedented advances in science and technology, or even existential risks to humanity if the AI is not aligned with human values.

human_429,"The Economist is a British weekly newspaper printed in demitab format and published digitally. It focuses on current affairs, international business, politics, technology, and culture. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by The Economist Group, with its core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2019, its average global print circulation was over 909,476; this, combined with its digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across its social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.
Founded in 1843, The Economist was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815–1846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its fire engine red nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, 1843, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.
The editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism as the concept became established in the late 20th century, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little reporting bias, and as exercising rigorous fact-checking and strict copyediting. Its extensive use of word play, high subscription prices, and depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations.[10][11] In line with this, it claims to have an influential readership of prominent business leaders and policy-makers.",0

human_431,"Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices. It is used to answer the question ""Who is speaking?"" The term voice recognition can refer to speaker recognition or speech recognition. Speaker verification (also called speaker authentication) contrasts with identification, and speaker recognition differs from speaker diarisation (recognizing when the same speaker is speaking).
Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on specific voices or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process. Speaker recognition has a history dating back some four decades as of 2019 and uses the acoustic features of speech that have been found to differ between individuals. These acoustic patterns reflect both anatomy and learned behavioral patterns.",0
ai_432,"Speaker recognition is a technology that is used to identify or verify the identity of a person based on the characteristics of their voice. It is often used in security systems to verify the identity of a person before granting them access to a certain area or system.



There are two main types of speaker recognition: speaker identification and speaker verification. Speaker identification is used to determine the identity of a speaker from a group of known speakers. This can be useful in situations where there is a need to identify an unknown speaker, such as in a criminal investigation. Speaker verification, on the other hand, is used to verify the identity of a speaker by comparing their voice to a known sample. This is often used in security systems to ensure that only authorized individuals can gain access to certain areas or systems.



Speaker recognition systems work by analyzing the unique characteristics of a person's voice, such as pitch, frequency, and the shape of the vocal tract. These characteristics are used to create a ""voiceprint,"" which is a unique identifier for a person's voice. The system compares the voiceprint of the speaker to a database of known voiceprints to determine their identity.



There are several factors that can affect the accuracy of speaker recognition systems, including the quality of the audio, the degree of variation in the speaker's voice over time, and the presence of background noise. Some speaker recognition systems are trained to handle these factors and can still provide accurate results, while others may be less reliable.",1
human_433,"In statistics, classification is the problem of identifying which of a set of categories (sub-populations) an observation (or observations) belongs to.  Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).
Often, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously as explanatory variables or features.  These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. ""A"", ""B"", ""AB"" or ""O"", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. ""large"", ""medium"" or ""small""), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Other classifiers work by comparing observations to previous observations by means of a similarity or distance function.
An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier.  The term ""classifier"" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.
Terminology across fields is quite varied. In statistics, where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of observations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables, regressors, etc.), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes, which are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable.  In machine learning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory variables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible categories to be predicted are classes.  Other fields may use different terminology: e.g. in community ecology, the term ""classification"" normally refers to cluster analysis.",0

human_437,"In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.
The model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.
Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).
This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.
Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).
Deciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.",0
ai_438,"Training data is a set of data used to train a machine learning model. The goal of training a machine learning model is to find patterns in the training data that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.



In order to train a machine learning model, you need to provide it with a large set of labeled examples. Each example consists of a set of input features and a corresponding output label. For example, in a machine learning model for image classification, the input features might be the pixels of an image, and the output label might be the class to which the image belongs (such as ""cat,"" ""dog,"" ""car,"" etc.).



The machine learning model uses these labeled examples to learn the patterns in the data that are associated with each output label. Once the model has been trained, it can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen examples by applying the patterns it learned during training to the new data.



Training data is a crucial part of the machine learning process, as the quality and quantity of the training data will directly impact the accuracy and performance of the resulting machine learning model.",1

Credit ratings are important because they help lenders, investors, and others assess the risk associated with lending money or investing in a particular borrower. A higher credit rating typically indicates a lower risk of default, meaning that the borrower is more likely to be able to pay back their debt on time. A lower credit rating, on the other hand, indicates a higher risk of default, meaning that the borrower may be less likely to pay back their debt on time.



Credit ratings are typically expressed as a letter or series of letters, with ""AAA"" being the highest rating and ""D"" being the lowest. The specific rating system used may vary depending on the credit rating agency and the type of borrower being rated.



It's worth noting that credit ratings are not static and can change over time. A borrower's credit rating may improve if they are able to demonstrate a strong track record of paying back debt, or it may deteriorate if they have difficulty making payments or experience other financial problems.",1
human_445,"Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.[19]
Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians.  In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford,  where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.[22]
Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[23][24]
Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.

More precisely, agents (beings with agency) may pursue instrumental goals—goals which are made in pursuit of some particular end, but are not the end goals themselves—without end, provided that their ultimate (intrinsic) goals may never be fully satisfied. Instrumental convergence posits that an intelligent agent with unbounded but apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways.

During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
Gates was born and raised in Seattle. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company.[a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda established in 2000.[10] He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.[12]
Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to 2013.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.[16] As of November 2022, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$107 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world.[17]
Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued many business and philanthropic endeavors.

human_463,"Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more compute in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IOT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. 
One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).
AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a ""Pay-as-you-go"" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.
Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[10] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[11][12]",0

There are several challenges involved in developing machine morality. One challenge is that it is difficult to determine what constitutes ethical behavior in different situations, as it can vary depending on cultural and individual perspectives. Another challenge is that it can be difficult to ensure that AI systems consistently behave ethically over time, as they may be subject to biases or unexpected changes in their environment.



There are also debates about the extent to which AI systems can be truly moral, as they do not have the same emotions and experiences as humans, and may not be able to fully understand the consequences of their actions. Some argue that it is not possible for AI systems to be truly moral, while others believe that they can be programmed to behave ethically and make moral decisions.



Overall, the goal of machine morality is to ensure that AI systems are designed and used in a way that is beneficial to society and respects the rights and values of individuals.

Cameron stated he devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to Conan the Destroyer (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Aliens (1986).

The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.
The Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value,[10][11] and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time,[12][13][14] and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.""[15]
The film's success led to two feature film sequels being released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled The Matrix Resurrections, was released on December 22, 2021.",0

human_489,"Aliens is a 1986 science fiction action film written and directed by James Cameron. It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film Alien, and the second film in the Alien franchise. The film is set in the far future; Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn feature in supporting roles.
Despite the success of Alien, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated changes in management. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for Aliens in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for The Terminator (1984) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5 million budget, Aliens began principal photography in September 1985. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.
Aliens was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. Aliens earned $131.1–183.3 million during its theatrical run, one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.
Aliens is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to (or better than) Alien. The film is credited with expanding the franchise's scope with additions to the series' backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. Aliens inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books, and toys. The film was followed by two sequels – Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997), neither of which were as successful, and the prequels Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017).",0

human_491,"Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. It is the first installment of the Dune saga. In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.
Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or ""spice"", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.
Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.
Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21, 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $401 million worldwide. It also went on to win six Academy Awards. Villeneuve's film was essentially the first half of the original novel, and a sequel, which will cover the remaining story, has begun production and is set for release in 2023. The series has been used as the basis for several board, role-playing, and video games.

human_493,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence (also known as A.I.) is a 2001 American science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson were based on the 1969 short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss. The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg, and Bonnie Curtis. It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, A.I. tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.
Development of A.I. originally began after producer/director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick.
A.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on June 29, 2001, in North America by Warner Bros. Pictures and internationally by DreamWorks Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed approximately $235 million against a budget of $90–100 million.

human_497,"Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction writer. He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity, and commonly featured characters struggling against elements such as alternate realities, illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness.
Born in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.
Following years of drug abuse and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in novels A Scanner Darkly (1977), VALIS (1981), and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke. Following his death, he became ""widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon"".[10]
Dick's posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking.[11] Popular films based on his works include  Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), Screamers (1995), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), The Adjustment Bureau (2011), and Radio Free Albemuth (2010). Beginning in 2015, Amazon Prime Video produced the multi-season television adaptation The Man in the High Castle, based on Dick's 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 began producing the ongoing anthology series Electric Dreams, based on various Dick stories.
In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923.[12]  In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer included in The Library of America series.[13][14][15]",0

Born to a Ukrainian Jewish family, Zelenskyy grew up as a native Russian speaker in Kryvyi Rih, a major city of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in central Ukraine. Prior to his acting career, he obtained a degree in law from the Kyiv National Economic University. He then pursued a career in comedy and created the production company Kvartal 95, which produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series Servant of the People, in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. A political party bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.
Zelenskyy announced his candidacy in the 2019 presidential election on the evening of 31 December 2018, alongside the New Year's Eve address of then-president Petro Poroshenko on the TV channel 1+1. A political outsider, he had already become one of the frontrunners in opinion polls for the election. He won the election with 73.23 percent of the vote in the second round, defeating Poroshenko.

During his presidential campaign, Zelenskyy promised to end Ukraine's protracted conflict with Russia, and he has attempted to engage in dialogue with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[10] His administration faced an escalation of tensions with Russia in 2021, culminating in the launch of an ongoing full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. Zelenskyy's strategy during the Russian military buildup was to calm the Ukrainian populace and assure the international community that Ukraine was not seeking to retaliate.[11] He initially distanced himself from warnings of an imminent war, while also calling for security guarantees and military support from NATO to ""withstand"" the threat.[12] After the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy declared martial law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international praise, and he has been described as a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.[13][14] Zelenskyy was named the Time Person of the Year for 2022 and opinion polls in Ukraine have ranked him as Ukraine's greatest president.[15][16][17][18]",0

human_505,"Cyber-diplomacy is the evolution of public diplomacy to include and use the new platforms of communication in the 21st century.  As explained by Jan Melissen in The New Public Diplomacy: Soft Power in International Relations, cyber-diplomacy “links the impact of innovations in communication and information technology to diplomacy.” Cyber-diplomacy is also known as or is part of public diplomacy 2.0, EDiplomacy, and virtual diplomacy.  Cyber-diplomacy has as its underpinnings that, “it recognizes that new communication technologies offer new opportunities to interact with a wider public by adopting a network approach and making the most of an increasingly multicentric global, interdependent system.” 
U.S. cyber-diplomacy is led by the United States Department of State and is a new tool in fulfilling the U.S. public diplomacy mission.  As stated by Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, the mission of American public diplomacy “is to support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance national security by informing and influencing foreign publics and by expanding and strengthening the relationship between the people and government of the United States and citizens of the rest of the world.” Even though the United States had engaged in cyber-diplomacy under President George W. Bush in 2006, the United States officially launched its cyber-diplomacy campaign in 2009. The development of cyber-diplomacy by the United States is a response to the shifts in international relations by extending the reach of U.S. diplomacy beyond government-to-government communications.  The U.S. is adapting its statecraft by reshaping its diplomatic agendas to meet old challenges in new ways and by utilizing America's innovation. Cyber-Diplomacy as identified by the United States Department of State, “encompasses a wide range of U.S. interests in cyberspace.  These include not only cyber security and Internet freedom, but also Internet governance, military uses of the Internet, innovation and economic growth.  Cyberspace has also become a foreign policy issue in multilateral fora, in our bilateral relationships, and in our relationships with industry and civil society.”",0

human_507,"Proactive cyber defence means acting in anticipation to oppose an attack through cyber and cognitive domains. Proactive cyber defence can be understood as options between offensive and defensive measures. It includes interdicting, disrupting or deterring an attack or a threat's preparation to attack, either pre-emptively or in self-defence. Common methods include cyber deception, attribution, threat hunting and adversarial pursuit. The mission of the pre-emptive and proactive operations is to conduct aggressive interception and disruption activities against an adversary using: psychological operations, managed information dissemination, precision targeting, information warfare operations, computer network exploitation, and other active threat reduction measures. The proactive defense strategy is meant to improve information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents and to provide strike options as well as to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battlespace. Proactive cyber defence can be a measure for detecting and obtaining information before a cyber attack, or it can also be impending cyber operation and be determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber counter-operation. 
The offensive capacity includes the manipulation and/or disruption of networks and systems with the purpose of limiting or eliminating the adversary's operational capability. This capability can be required to guarantee one's freedom of action in the cyber domain. Cyber-attacks can be launched to repel an attack (active defence) or to support the operational action. Proactive cyber defence differs from active defence, meaning that it is pre-emptive (not waiting for an attack to occur). The distinction between active cyber defence and offensive cyber operations (OCO) is that the later requires legislative exceptions to undertake. Hence, offensive cyber capabilities may be developed in collaboration with industry and facilitated by private sector. But, these operations are often led by nation-states.",0

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the party's nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party; Clinton won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College vote, thereby losing the election to Donald Trump.
Raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, Clinton co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative—the Clinton health care plan—failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. Clinton advocated for gender equality at the 1995 UN conference on women. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.
In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York and became the first First lady to simultaneously hold elected office, and then the first former First lady to serve in the Senate. She was re-elected in 2006 and chaired the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee from 2003 to 2007. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was impacted in the September 11 attacks. She supported the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State in the first term of the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton established the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya but was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Her use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election.
Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016, winning the Democratic nomination, and ran in the general election with Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College, despite winning the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups.",0

human_513,"Health care or healthcare is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all constitute health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.
Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means ""the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes"". Factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the possibility to take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
Health systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.
An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy, development, and industrialization. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.",0

human_515,"Data analysis  is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.
Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information. In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses on the application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.
Data integration is a precursor to data analysis, and data analysis is closely linked to data visualization and data dissemination.",0

human_517,"In machine learning, feature learning or representation learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform  a specific task.
Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensor data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.
Feature learning can be either supervised, unsupervised or self-supervised.",0
ai_518,"Representation learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model to learn meaningful and useful representations of data, typically for the purpose of improving the model's ability to perform a particular task.



Representation learning is motivated by the idea that it is often easier for a model to learn to perform a task using a suitable representation of the input data rather than the raw data itself. For example, a model might learn to classify images of animals more accurately if it is first trained to recognize features such as the shape of the animal's head or the patterns on its fur, rather than trying to classify the raw pixel data of the image.



There are many different approaches to representation learning, including techniques such as unsupervised learning, transfer learning, and deep learning. Unsupervised learning methods can be used to learn representations of data without the need for labeled examples, while transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model to learn a new task by adapting its learned representation to the new task. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, can also be used for representation learning, particularly for tasks such as image and audio processing.",1
human_519,"Weak supervision is a branch of machine learning where noisy, limited, or imprecise sources are used to provide supervision signal for labeling large amounts of training data in a supervised learning setting. This approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand-labeled data sets, which can be costly or impractical. Instead, inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect, but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model.",0
ai_520,"Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that involves training a model using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. In supervised learning, a model is trained using a labeled dataset, where the correct output is provided for each example in the training set. In contrast, in unsupervised learning, the model is not provided with any labeled examples and must learn to find patterns in the data on its own.



Semi-supervised learning falls between these two approaches, as it involves using a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data to train a model. The idea is that the model can learn from the labeled data and use that knowledge to make predictions about the unlabeled data. This can be especially useful in situations where it is expensive or time-consuming to label a large dataset, or when there is a limited amount of labeled data available.



One way to implement semi-supervised learning is through the use of self-learning, where the model is first trained on a small amount of labeled data and then used to label additional examples from the unlabeled dataset. These newly labeled examples are then added to the training set and the model is re-trained. This process can be repeated multiple times until the model has learned to accurately predict the labels for the majority of the dataset.



Semi-supervised learning has been successful in a number of applications, including natural language processing, image classification, and speech recognition. It can also be used in conjunction with other machine learning techniques, such as transfer learning, to improve the performance of the model.",1
human_521,"In machine learning, a deep belief network (DBN) is a generative graphical model, or alternatively a class of deep neural network, composed of multiple layers of latent variables (""hidden units""), with connections between the layers but not between units within each layer.
When trained on a set of examples without supervision, a DBN can learn to probabilistically reconstruct its inputs. The layers then act as feature detectors. After this learning step, a DBN can be further trained with supervision to perform classification.
DBNs can be viewed as a composition of simple, unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or autoencoders, where each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next. An RBM is an undirected, generative energy-based model with a ""visible"" input layer and a hidden layer and connections between but not within layers. This composition leads to a fast, layer-by-layer unsupervised training procedure, where contrastive divergence is applied to each sub-network in turn, starting from the ""lowest"" pair of layers (the lowest visible layer is a training set).
The observation that DBNs can be trained greedily, one layer at a time, led to one of the first effective deep learning algorithms.: 6  Overall, there are many attractive implementations and uses of DBNs in real-life applications and scenarios (e.g., electroencephalography, drug discovery).",0

Deep RL algorithms are able to take in very large inputs (e.g. every pixel rendered to the screen in a video game) and decide what actions to perform to optimize an objective (e.g. maximizing the game score). Deep reinforcement learning has been used for a diverse set of applications including but not limited to robotics, video games, natural language processing, computer vision, education, transportation, finance and healthcare.",0
ai_524,"Deep reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that combines reinforcement learning with deep learning.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. These neural networks are composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, and they are able to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data by adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the nodes.

human_525,"Drug design, often referred to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals including peptides and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.
The phrase ""drug design"" is to some extent a misnomer. A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug.  Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to select compounds with more favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicological profiles.",0
ai_526,"Drug design, also known as rational drug design or rational design, is the process of identifying and developing new drugs based on a thorough understanding of the biological target.

The goal is to design a molecule that will bind to the target in a way that either activates or inhibits its function, depending on the desired therapeutic effect.



Once a potential drug candidate has been identified, it undergoes a series of preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and potential side effects. If the drug candidate is shown to be effective and safe, it may be approved for use as a medication.

human_535,"In statistical classification, two main approaches are called the generative approach and the discriminative approach. These compute classifiers by different approaches, differing in the degree of statistical modelling. Terminology is inconsistent,[a] but three major types can be distinguished, following Jebara (2004):
The distinction between these last two classes is not consistently made; Jebara (2004) refers to these three classes as generative learning, conditional learning, and discriminative learning, but Ng & Jordan (2002) only distinguish two classes, calling them generative classifiers (joint distribution) and discriminative classifiers (conditional distribution or no distribution), not distinguishing between the latter two classes. Analogously, a classifier based on a generative model is a generative classifier, while a classifier based on a discriminative model is a discriminative classifier, though this term also refers to classifiers that are not based on a model.
Standard examples of each, all of which are linear classifiers, are:
In application to classification, one wishes to go from an observation x to a label y (or probability distribution on labels). One can compute this directly, without using a probability distribution (distribution-free classifier); one can estimate the probability of a label given an observation,

It is a statistical physics technique applied in the context of cognitive science. It is also classified as a Markov random field.
Boltzmann machines are theoretically intriguing because of the locality and Hebbian nature of their training algorithm (being trained by Hebb's rule), and because of their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes.  Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not been proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference, but if the connectivity is properly constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems.
They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics, which is used in their sampling function.  They were heavily popularized and promoted by Geoffrey Hinton, Terry Sejnowski and Yann LeCun in cognitive sciences communities and in machine learning.

Without further specifications, matrices represent linear maps, and allow explicit computations in linear algebra. Therefore, the study of matrices is a large part of linear algebra, and most properties and operations of abstract linear algebra can be expressed in terms of matrices. For example, matrix multiplication represents composition of linear maps.
Not all matrices are related to linear algebra. This is, in particular, the case in graph theory, of incidence matrices, and adjacency matrices. This article focuses on matrices related to linear algebra, and, unless otherwise specified, all matrices represent linear maps or may be viewed as such.
Square matrices, matrices with the same number of rows and columns, play a major role in matrix theory. Square matrices of a given dimension form a noncommutative ring, which is one of the most common examples of a noncommutative ring. The determinant of a square matrix is a number associated to the matrix, which is fundamental for the study of a square matrix; for example, a square matrix is invertible if and only if it has a nonzero determinant, and the eigenvalues of a square matrix are the roots of a polynomial determinant.
In geometry, matrices are widely used for specifying and representing geometric transformations (for example rotations) and coordinate changes. In numerical analysis, many computational problems are solved by reducing them to a matrix computation, and this often involves computing with matrices of huge dimension. Matrices are used in most areas of mathematics and most scientific fields, either directly, or through their use in geometry and numerical analysis.",0

In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.
For example, a greedy strategy for the travelling salesman problem (which is of high computational complexity) is the following heuristic: ""At each step of the journey, visit the nearest unvisited city."" This heuristic does not intend to find the best solution, but it terminates in a reasonable number of steps; finding an optimal solution to such a complex problem typically requires unreasonably many steps. In mathematical optimization, greedy algorithms optimally solve combinatorial problems having the properties of matroids and give constant-factor approximations to optimization problems with the submodular structure.",0
ai_542,"A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the most locally beneficial choice at each step in the hope of finding a globally optimal solution.



Here's an example to illustrate the concept of a greedy algorithm:



Suppose you are given a list of tasks that need to be completed, each with a specific deadline and a time required to complete it. Your goal is to complete as many tasks as possible within the given deadline. A greedy algorithm would approach this problem by always selecting the task that can be completed in the shortest amount of time first. This approach may not always lead to the optimal solution, as it may be better to complete tasks with longer completion times earlier if they have earlier deadlines. However, in some cases, the greedy approach may indeed lead to the optimal solution.



In general, greedy algorithms are simple to implement and can be efficient for solving certain types of problems. However, they are not always the best choice for solving all types of problems, as they may not always lead to the optimal solution. It is important to carefully consider the specific problem being solved and whether a greedy algorithm is likely to be effective before using one.",1
human_543,"Feature engineering or feature extraction  or feature discovery is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data.  The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process, compared with supplying only the raw data to the machine learning process.",0
ai_544,"Feature engineering is the process of designing and creating features for machine learning models. These features are inputs for the model, and they represent the different characteristics or attributes of the data being used to train the model.



The goal of feature engineering is to extract the most relevant and useful information from the raw data and to transform it into a form that can be easily used by machine learning algorithms. This process involves selecting and combining different pieces of data, as well as applying various transformations and techniques to extract the most useful features.



Effective feature engineering can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models, as it helps to identify the most important factors that influence the outcome of the model and to eliminate noise or irrelevant data. It is an important part of the machine learning workflow, and it requires a deep understanding of the data and the problem being solved.",1
human_545,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 unit vectors, where the 



i


{\displaystyle i}

-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first 



i
−
1


{\displaystyle i-1}

 vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.
In data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  



p


{\displaystyle p}

 variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  



p


{\displaystyle p}

 iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.
PCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The 



i


{\displaystyle i}

-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first 



i
−
1


{\displaystyle i-1}

 principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.
For either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.",0
ai_546,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set. It does this by identifying the directions in which the data varies the most, and then projecting the data onto a new set of axes that are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other. These new axes are called ""principal components"", and they are ranked in order of importance, with the first principal component having the highest importance and the last principal component having the lowest importance.



The purpose of PCA is to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the variance in the data as possible. This can be useful for visualizing the data, or for finding patterns in the data that might not be apparent in the original high-dimensional space.



To perform PCA, you first need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Then, you compute the covariance matrix of the data, and use singular value decomposition (SVD) to decompose the covariance matrix into its principal components. Finally, you can select the number of principal components to keep, and project the data onto the resulting low-dimensional space.



PCA is a widely used technique in data analysis and machine learning, and it has many applications, including feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization.",1
human_547,"In the mathematical theory of artificial neural networks, universal approximation theorems are results that establish the density of an algorithmically generated class of functions within a given function space of interest.  Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology.
However, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, radial basis-functions, or neural networks with specific properties. Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (""arbitrary width"" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (""arbitrary depth"" case). In addition to these two classes, there are also universal approximation theorems for neural networks with bounded number of hidden layers and a limited number of neurons in each layer (""bounded depth and bounded width"" case).
Universal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions when given appropriate weights. On the other hand, they typically do not provide a construction for the weights, but merely state that such a construction is possible.",0
ai_548,"The universal approximation theorem is a result in the theory of artificial neural networks that states that a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of R^n, under mild assumptions on the activation function. The theorem was first proved by George Cybenko in 1989, although similar results were proven earlier by Kolmogorov, Arbib, and others.



The theorem states that, given any continuous function f(x) defined on a compact subset D of R^n, and given any positive real number ε, there exists a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer and a finite number of neurons, such that the network can approximate f(x) to within ε on the subset D. The number of neurons required in the hidden layer depends on the complexity of the function f(x) and the desired level of approximation ε.



The universal approximation theorem is significant because it shows that feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer have the potential to approximate a wide range of functions, and can therefore be used for a wide range of tasks. However, it is important to note that the theorem only guarantees the existence of a neural network that can approximate a given function, and does not provide a method for constructing such a network.",1

ai_550,"A feedforward neural network is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to receive input, process it, and produce an output. It is called a feedforward network because the information flows through the network in only one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without looping back.



In a feedforward neural network, the input data is passed through a series of hidden layers, where it is transformed by a set of weights and biases, before finally reaching the output layer. The output is then compared to the desired output, and the error is used to adjust the weights and biases in order to improve the accuracy of the model.



Feedforward neural networks are widely used in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. They are relatively simple and easy to understand, making them a good choice for many tasks. However, they are limited in their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships, and may not perform as well as more advanced types of neural networks on certain tasks.",1
human_551,"In mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a continuous variation (that is a change without jump) of the argument induces a continuous variation of the value of the function. This means that there are no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is not continuous. Up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, and considered only continuous functions. The epsilon–delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.
Continuity is one of the core concepts of calculus and mathematical analysis, where arguments and values of functions are real and complex numbers. The concept has been generalized to functions between metric spaces and between topological spaces. The latter are the most general continuous functions, and their definition is the basis of topology.
A stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In order theory, especially in domain theory, a related concept of continuity is Scott continuity.
As an example, the function H(t) denoting the height of a growing flower at time t would be considered continuous. In contrast, the function M(t) denoting the amount of money in a bank account at time t would be considered discontinuous, since it ""jumps"" at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn.",0
ai_552,"In mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any sudden jumps, breaks, or discontinuities. This means that if you were to graph the function on a coordinate plane, the graph would be a single, unbroken curve without any gaps or interruptions.



There are several properties that a function must satisfy in order to be considered continuous. Firstly, the function must be defined for all values in its domain. Secondly, the function must have a finite limit at every point in its domain. Finally, the function must be able to be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.



Continuous functions are important in mathematics and other fields because they can be studied and analyzed using the tools of calculus, which include techniques such as differentiation and integration. These techniques are used to study the behavior of functions, find the slope of their graphs, and calculate areas under their curves.



Examples of continuous functions include polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions. These functions are used in a wide range of applications, including modeling real-world phenomena, solving engineering problems, and predicting financial trends.",1

human_554,"A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic ""S""-shaped curve or sigmoid curve.
A common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function shown in the first figure and defined by the formula:
Other standard sigmoid functions are given in the Examples section. In some fields, most notably in the context of artificial neural networks, the term ""sigmoid function"" is used as an alias for the logistic function.
Special cases of the sigmoid function include the Gompertz curve (used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x) and the ogee curve (used in the spillway of some dams). Sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers, with return (response) value commonly monotonically increasing but could be decreasing. Sigmoid functions most often show a return value (y axis) in the range 0 to 1. Another commonly used range is from −1 to 1.
A wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions (which go from 0 to 1), such as the integrals of the logistic density, the normal density, and Student's t probability density functions. The logistic sigmoid function is invertible, and its inverse is the logit function.",0
ai_555,"The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1. It is defined by the following equation:



sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))



where x is the input value and e is the mathematical constant known as Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.718.



The sigmoid function is often used in machine learning and artificial neural networks because it has a number of useful properties. One of these properties is that the output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1, which makes it useful for modeling probabilities or binary classification problems. Another property is that the derivative of the sigmoid function is easy to compute, which makes it useful for training neural networks using gradient descent.



The shape of the sigmoid function is S-shaped, with the output approaching 0 as the input becomes more negative and approaching 1 as the input becomes more positive. The point at which the output is exactly 0.5 occurs at x=0.",1
human_556,"In mathematics, the integral of a non-negative function of a single variable can be regarded, in the simplest case, as the area between the graph of that function and the x-axis. The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.
Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons.  However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e.g., as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral.  Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the necessary abstractions for this.
The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904). It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability.
The term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on a sub-domain of the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.",0
ai_557,"In mathematics, Lebesgue integration is a method of defining and computing the integral of a real-valued function on a measure space. It is a generalization of the Riemann integral, which is used to integrate functions defined on a finite interval.



The Lebesgue integral is named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, who introduced it in his dissertation in 1902. It has become a standard tool in modern analysis and has many important applications in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, probability theory, and partial differential equations.



The Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of measure theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the concept of ""measure,"" which is a way of assigning a size or length to sets. In particular, the Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of a measure called the Lebesgue measure, which is a way of assigning a measure to sets in the real line.



To define the Lebesgue integral, we first need to define a measure space, which is a set equipped with a measure. In the case of the Lebesgue integral, the measure space is the set of real numbers equipped with the Lebesgue measure.



Next, we need to define a real-valued function on the measure space. This is a function that assigns a real number to each element in the measure space.



To define the Lebesgue integral of a function, we partition the measure space into a finite number of disjoint measurable sets, called ""measurable partitions."" We then assign a value to each measurable partition, called the ""integral over the measurable partition."" The Lebesgue integral of the function is then defined as the limit of the sum of the integrals over the measurable partitions as the number of partitions goes to infinity.



The Lebesgue integral has many important properties, including the ability to integrate functions that are not continuous, and the ability to handle functions that have ""jumps"" or other singularities. It is also a very powerful tool for proving the convergence of sequences and series of functions.",1
human_558,"An examination (exam or evaluation) or test is an educational assessment intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs). A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.
Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. There is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies.
A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent to a child. A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an IQ test administered by a psychologist in a clinic. Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score. A test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants.
A test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider.

ai_563,"In machine learning and neural networks, dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting. It works by randomly ""dropping out"" a certain number of neurons during training, which means temporarily setting the output of those neurons to zero. This has the effect of reducing the dependence of the model on any one particular neuron, and can help the model generalize better to new data.



Dropout is typically applied to fully-connected layers in a neural network, although it can also be applied to convolutional layers. It is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques such as weight decay (L2 regularization) and early stopping.



To implement dropout in a neural network, we randomly set a certain percentage of neurons to zero during each training iteration. During inference (i.e., when making predictions on new data), we do not use dropout and instead use the entire network. This has the effect of ""averaging"" the predictions of all the dropped-out neurons, which helps reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.



Dropout has been shown to be effective at reducing overfitting in deep neural networks and is a common technique used in modern deep learning models.",1
human_564,"In mathematics, statistics, finance, computer science, particularly in machine learning and inverse problems, regularization is a process that changes the result answer to be ""simpler"". It is often used to obtain results for ill-posed problems or to prevent overfitting.
Although regularization procedures can be divided in many ways, following delineation is particularly helpful:
In explicit regularization, independent of the problem or model, there is always a data term, that corresponds to a likelihood of the measurement and a regularization term that corresponds to a prior. By combining both using Bayesian statistics, one can compute a posterior, that includes both information sources and therefore stabilizes the estimation process. By trading off both objectives, one chooses to be more addictive to the data or to enforce generalization (to prevent overfitting). There is a whole research branch dealing with all possible regularizations. The work flow usually is, that one tries a specific regularization and then figures out the probability density that corresponds to that regularization to justify the choice. It can also be physically motivated by common sense or intuition.
In machine learning, the data term corresponds to the training data and the regularization is either the choice of the model or modifications to the algorithm. It is always intended to reduce the generalization error, i.e. the error score with the trained model on the evaluation set and not the training data.
One of the earliest uses of regularization is Tikhonov regularization, related to the method of least squares.",0
ai_565,"In mathematics, regularization refers to the process of modifying a mathematical problem or equation in order to make it better-behaved or easier to solve. This is often done in order to avoid certain types of solutions that may be undesirable or undesirable, such as solutions that are not unique or solutions that produce divergent results.



One common example of regularization is the addition of a penalty term to an optimization problem. For example, suppose we have a function that we want to optimize, but we know that the solutions to the optimization problem may not be unique or may have undesirable properties. We can add a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes solutions that have these undesirable properties, which helps to steer the optimization towards solutions that are more desirable.



Another example of regularization is the use of smoothing techniques in data fitting and interpolation. When fitting a curve to a set of data points, it is often desirable to find a curve that is smooth and does not oscillate too much between points. By adding a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes the curvature or complexity of the curve, we can encourage the optimization algorithm to find a smoother curve that fits the data better.

ai_574,"A Boolean network is a mathematical model used to represent the behavior of a dynamic system as a network of Boolean variables and functions. The variables in a Boolean network can have only two states: ""true"" or ""false,"" and the functions specify the rules for how the variables update their states based on the states of other variables in the network.



Boolean networks are often used to model the behavior of complex systems, such as genetic regulatory networks or social networks. They are particularly useful for studying the behavior of systems that exhibit binary (either/or) behavior, or for modeling the interactions between different components of a system.



In a Boolean network, each variable is represented by a node in the network, and the functions specifying the rules for updating the state of each variable are represented by edges connecting the nodes. The state of the network at any given time can be represented by the configuration of the nodes, and the dynamics of the network can be studied by iteratively updating the state of the nodes according to the rules specified by the edges.



Boolean networks have been used in a variety of applications, including the study of cellular automata, the analysis of biological systems, and the design of computer circuits. They have also been used to study the behavior of social and economic systems, as well as the spread of diseases and information.",1

human_577,"In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation, auto-differentiation, or simply autodiff, is a set of techniques to evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.
Automatic differentiation is distinct from symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation. 
Symbolic differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code. Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both of these classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase. Finally, both of these classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.",0
ai_578,"Automatic differentiation (AD) is a technique for numerically evaluating the derivative of a function defined by a computer program. It allows one to efficiently compute the gradient of a function with respect to its inputs, which is often needed in machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing.



AD can be used to differentiate a function that is defined as a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and elementary functions (such as exp, log, and sin). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, AD can compute the derivative of the function with respect to any of its inputs, without the need to manually derive the derivative using calculus.



There are two main approaches to implementing AD: forward mode and reverse mode. Forward mode AD computes the derivative of the function with respect to each input separately, while reverse mode AD computes the derivative of the function with respect to all of the inputs simultaneously. Reverse mode AD is more efficient when the number of inputs is much larger than the number of outputs, while forward mode AD is more efficient when the number of outputs is larger than the number of inputs.



AD has many applications in machine learning, where it is used to compute the gradients of loss functions with respect to the model parameters during training. It is also used in optimization, where it can be used to find the minimum or maximum of a function by gradient descent or other optimization algorithms. In scientific computing, AD can be used to compute the sensitivity of a model or simulation to its inputs, or to perform parameter estimation by minimizing the difference between model predictions and observations.",1

He is Founder and CEO of Deep Genomics, Cofounder of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Professor of Engineering and Medicine at the University of Toronto. Frey is a pioneer in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, their use in accurately determining the consequences of genetic mutations, and in designing medications that can slow, stop or reverse the progression of disease.
As far back as 1995, Frey co-invented one of the first deep learning methods, called the wake-sleep algorithm, the affinity propagation algorithm for clustering and data summarization, and the factor graph notation for probability models. In the late 1990s, Frey was a leading researcher in the areas of computer vision, speech recognition, and digital communications. In 2002, a personal crisis led Frey to face the fact that there was a tragic gap between our ability to measure a patient's mutations and our ability to understand and treat the consequences. Recognizing that biology is too complex for humans to understand, that in the decades to come there would be an exponential growth in biology data, and that machine learning is the best technology we have for discovering relationships in large datasets, Frey set out to build machine learning systems that could accurately predict genome and cell biology. His group pioneered much of the early work in the field and over the next 15 years published more papers in leading-edge journals than any other academic or industrial research lab.

The basic idea behind the wake-sleep algorithm is to use two neural networks, called the ""generative"" network and the ""recognition"" network, to learn a model of the data distribution. The generative network is trained to generate samples from the data distribution, while the recognition network is trained to recognize the generated samples as being drawn from the data distribution.



During the ""wake"" phase of the algorithm, the generative network is used to generate samples from the data distribution, and the recognition network is used to evaluate the likelihood of these samples being drawn from the data distribution. During the ""sleep"" phase, the recognition network is used to generate samples from the data distribution, and the generative network is used to evaluate the likelihood of these samples being drawn from the data distribution.

They have been found to be particularly appropriate for texture representation and discrimination. In the spatial domain, a 2-D Gabor filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave (see Gabor transform).
Some authors claim that simple cells in the visual cortex of mammalian brains can be modeled by Gabor functions. Thus, image analysis with Gabor filters is thought by some to be similar to perception in the human visual system.",0
ai_590,"A Gabor filter is a type of filter used in image processing that is designed to emphasize certain frequencies in an image. It is named after Dennis Gabor, who invented the concept of holography, which is a technique for recording and reconstructing three-dimensional images.



Gabor filters are typically used in image processing to extract features from images, such as edges or textures. They are particularly useful for tasks such as object recognition, because they can help to highlight important features in the image that are relevant for identifying the object.



Gabor filters work by convolving an image with a complex sinusoidal wave, which is modulated by a Gaussian function. The parameters of the Gabor filter can be adjusted to emphasize different frequencies in the image, depending on the task at hand. For example, a Gabor filter with a high frequency parameter will emphasize fine details in the image, while a Gabor filter with a low frequency parameter will emphasize broad features.



Gabor filters have been widely used in image processing and computer vision, and they have proven to be effective at extracting features from images for a variety of applications.",1
human_591,"In statistics, a mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, without requiring that an observed data set should identify the sub-population to which an individual observation belongs. Formally a mixture model corresponds to the mixture distribution that represents the probability distribution of observations in the overall population. However, while problems associated with ""mixture distributions"" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, ""mixture models"" are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.
Mixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1.",0
ai_592,"A mixture model is a probabilistic model that represents a combination of multiple probability distributions. It is a flexible tool for modeling data that can be represented as a mixture of different underlying distributions.



In a mixture model, the data is assumed to be generated by a mixture of different probability distributions, rather than a single distribution. Each of these distributions is referred to as a component of the mixture model. The mixture model assigns a weight to each component, indicating the probability that a data point was generated by that component. The weights sum to 1, and they represent the probability that a data point was generated by each of the components.



Mixture models are commonly used in a variety of applications, including density estimation, clustering, and classification. They are particularly useful when the data exhibits complex structure or when it is not clear which probability distribution best describes the data.



For example, consider a set of data points that represent the heights of individuals in a population. It is possible that the heights of the individuals in this population are distributed according to a normal distribution, but it is also possible that the distribution is more complex, with multiple modes or outliers. In this case, a mixture model could be used to model the data by fitting a normal distribution and an additional distribution to represent the complex structure of the data.",1

SRI performs client-sponsored research and development for government agencies, commercial businesses, and private foundations. It also licenses its technologies, forms strategic partnerships, sells products, and creates spin-off companies. SRI's headquarters are located near the Stanford University campus.
SRI's annual revenue in 2014 was approximately $540 million, which tripled from 1998 under the leadership of Curtis Carlson. In 1998, the organization was on the verge of bankruptcy when Carlson took over as CEO. Over the next sixteen years with Carlson as CEO, the organizational culture of SRI was transformed. SRI tripled in size, became very profitable, and created many world-changing innovations, using NABC Framework.

human_595,"The National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT). The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine.[10] The existence of the NSA was not revealed until 1975. The NSA has roughly 32,000 employees.[11]
Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II, it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952. Between then and the end of the Cold War, it became the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget, but information available as of 2013 indicates that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) pulled ahead in this regard, with a budget of $14.7 billion.[12] The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end.[13] The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet, which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program.[14][15] The NSA, alongside the CIA, maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service (a highly classified intelligence team) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets (such as presidential palaces or embassies). SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass ""close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering"".[16]
Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage, the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering. The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations – which are prevented by Executive Order from engaging in such activities on their own.[17] As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense cryptanalysis components. To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions, the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service.
The NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including its spying on anti–Vietnam War leaders and the agency's participation in economic espionage. In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens. The documents also revealed the NSA tracks hundreds of millions of people's movements using cellphones' metadata. Internationally, research has pointed to the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through ""boomerang routing"".[18]",0

human_597,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network  used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare.[11]
The name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both ""long-term memory"" and ""short-term memory"". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus ""long short-term memory"".
A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.
LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]",0
ai_598,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited to model sequential data, such as time series or natural language.

However, LSTMs are designed to overcome the vanishing and exploding gradient problems that can occur when training traditional RNNs, allowing them to model longer-term dependencies in the data.



LSTMs consist of a number of ""cells"" that process the input data, each of which contains three types of gates: input gates, output gates, and forget gates. These gates allow the LSTM to selectively preserve or discard information from the internal state, and to regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.

human_604,"A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.
RBMs were initially invented under the name Harmonium by Paul Smolensky in 1986,
and rose to prominence after Geoffrey Hinton and collaborators invented fast learning algorithms for them in the mid-2000. RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction,
classification,
collaborative filtering, feature learning,
topic modelling
and even many body quantum mechanics. They can be trained in either supervised or unsupervised ways, depending on the task.
As their name implies, RBMs are a variant of Boltzmann machines, with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph: 
a pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the ""visible"" and ""hidden"" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, ""unrestricted"" Boltzmann machines may have connections between hidden units. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.
Restricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by ""stacking"" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation.[10]",0
ai_605,"A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a type of neural network that can learn a probability distribution over a set of inputs. RBMs are generative models, meaning that they can generate new data samples that are similar to a training set. They are particularly useful for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and collaborative filtering.



An RBM consists of visible units, which represent the input data, and hidden units, which capture the underlying structure of the data. The connections between the visible and hidden units are called weights, and there are no connections between the hidden units or between the visible units. The hidden units are used to extract features from the input data, and the visible units are used to reconstruct the input data from these features.



RBMs can be trained using an algorithm called contrastive divergence, which involves making small updates to the weights of the network based on the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data. The goal of training is to minimize this difference, so that the RBM can accurately reconstruct the input data.

It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.
Some speech recognition systems require ""training"" (also called ""enrollment"") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called ""speaker-independent"" systems. Systems that use training are called ""speaker dependent"".
Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. ""call home""), call routing (e.g. ""I would like to make a collect call""), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).
The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.
From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.",0
ai_607,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a technology that enables computers to recognize and transcribe spoken language into written or computer-readable text. ASR systems can be used to transcribe spoken words into text for a variety of applications, such as dictation, transcription of recorded speech, or real-time captioning of live events.



ASR systems use complex algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze spoken language and identify the words and phrases being spoken. The system compares the spoken input to a database of pre-recorded words and phrases and uses statistical models to determine the most likely transcription.



ASR systems have become increasingly accurate and widespread in recent years, and are used in a variety of applications including voice assistants, transcription services, and speech-to-text software. They have the potential to significantly improve productivity and accessibility for individuals who have difficulty typing or writing, and can also be used to transcribe spoken language in multiple languages.",1
human_608,"The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by ""re-mixing"" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset. The original creators of the database keep a list of some of the methods tested on it. In their original paper, they use a support-vector machine to get an error rate of 0.8%.[10]
Extended MNIST (EMNIST) is a newer dataset developed and released by NIST to be the (final) successor to MNIST.[11][12] MNIST included images only of handwritten digits.  EMNIST includes all the images from NIST Special Database 19, which is a large database of handwritten uppercase and lower case letters as well as digits.[13][14] The images in EMNIST were converted into the same 28x28 pixel format, by the same process, as were the MNIST images. Accordingly, tools which work with the older, smaller, MNIST dataset will likely work unmodified with EMNIST.",0

human_610,"A decision tree  is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.
Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.",0
ai_611,"A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision-making process. It is a flowchart-like tree structure, where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree recursively called Recursive Partitioning.



For example, you might use a decision tree to help you decide whether to play tennis on a given day. The tree might consider various factors, such as the weather forecast, the temperature, and your schedule, to help you make a decision. The tree would have branches representing each of these factors, and the leaves of the tree would represent the final decision (e.g., ""play tennis"" or ""do not play tennis"").



Decision trees are often used in machine learning and data mining for classification and regression tasks. They are simple to understand and interpret, and they can handle both numerical and categorical data. However, they can be prone to overfitting and may not always be the most accurate or efficient solution for a given problem.",1

The cells that make up the nervous system are called neurons, and they are specialized for transmitting information. Neurons communicate with each other and with other cells in the body through synapses, which are specialized junctions that allow for the exchange of electrical and chemical signals.

human_626,"Labeled data is a group of samples that have been tagged with one or more labels. Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of it with informative tags. For example, a data label might indicate whether a photo contains a horse or a cow, which words were uttered in an audio recording, what type of action is being performed in a video, what the topic of a news article is, what the overall sentiment of a tweet is, or whether a dot in an X-ray is a tumor.
Labels can be obtained by asking humans to make judgments about a given piece of unlabeled data. Labeled data is significantly more expensive to obtain than the raw unlabeled data.",0
ai_627,"Labeled data is a type of data that has been labeled, or annotated, with a classification or category.

For example, a dataset of images of animals might have labels such as ""cat,"" ""dog,"" or ""bird"" to indicate the type of animal in each image.



Labeled data is often used to train machine learning models, as the labels provide the model with a way to learn about the relationships between different data points and make predictions about new, unlabeled data. In this case, the labels act as the ""ground truth"" for the model, allowing it to learn how to accurately classify new data points based on their characteristics.



Labeled data can be created manually, by humans who annotate the data with labels, or it can be generated automatically using techniques such as data preprocessing or data augmentation. It is important to have a large and diverse set of labeled data in order to train a high-quality machine learning model.",1
human_628,"Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:
and are read declaratively as logical implications:
H is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:
In the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.
In ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:
Consider the following clause as an example:
based on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:
can be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by ""assigning"" socrates to X.
The declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.",0
ai_629,"Rule-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the behavior of a system is defined by a set of rules that describe how the system should respond to specific inputs or situations. These rules are typically expressed in the form of if-then statements, where the ""if"" part of the statement specifies a condition or trigger, and the ""then"" part specifies the action that should be taken if the condition is met.



Rule-based systems are often used in artificial intelligence and expert systems, where they are used to encode the knowledge and expertise of a domain expert in a form that can be processed by a computer. They can also be used in other areas of programming, such as natural language processing, where they can be used to define the grammar and syntax of a language, or in automated decision-making systems, where they can be used to evaluate data and make decisions based on predefined rules.



One of the key advantages of rule-based programming is that it allows for the creation of systems that can adapt and change their behavior based on new information or changing circumstances. This makes them well-suited for use in dynamic environments, where the rules that govern the system's behavior may need to be modified or updated over time. However, rule-based systems can also be complex and difficult to maintain, as they may require the creation and management of large numbers of rules in order to function properly.",1
human_630,"An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function[clarification needed]. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often  monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.
The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function.

human_632,"In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a distance, duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations.[a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.[b]
The real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.[c]
The set of real numbers is denoted R or 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 and is sometimes called ""the reals"".
The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of −1), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.
The real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).
Real numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.
Conversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.
The informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.",0

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers and that cannot be expressed as a finite decimal. These numbers have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point, and they do not repeat in a pattern. Examples of irrational numbers include the square root of 2 (1.41421356...) and the constant pi (3.14159265...).

human_640,"In computer science, primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use. Most processors support a similar set of primitive data types, although the specific representations vary. More generally, ""primitive data types"" may refer to the standard data types built into a programming language. Data types which are not primitive are referred to as derived or composite.
Primitive types are almost always value types, but composite types may also be value types.",0
ai_641,"In computer programming, a primitive data type is a data type that is not derived from any other data type. Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of a programming language, and are used to represent simple values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and characters.



Some examples of primitive data types in the Java programming language include:



int: an integer data type that represents a whole number.

double: a floating-point data type that represents a decimal number.

char: a character data type that represents a single character, such as a letter or symbol.

boolean: a boolean data type that represents a true or false value.

Other programming languages may have different primitive data types, or may use different names for the same types. However, most programming languages have a set of primitive data types that are similar to those found in Java.",1
human_642,"In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and positive-integer powers of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate x is x2 − 4x + 7. An example with three indeterminates is x3 + 2xyz2 − yz + 1.
Polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary word problems to complicated scientific problems; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science; they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions. In advanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties, which are central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry.",0
ai_643,"In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and sometimes division (though this is not always allowed). For example, the polynomial 3x^2 + 2x - 5 is a polynomial in the variable x. The highest power of the variable in a polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the polynomial is 2 because the highest power of x is 2.



A multivariate polynomial is a polynomial with more than one variable. For example, the expression 2x^2 + y^3 - 3z + 4 is a multivariate polynomial in the variables x, y, and z. The degree of a multivariate polynomial is the highest power of the variables in the polynomial. In this case, the degree of the polynomial is 3 because the highest power of any of the variables is 3 (in the term y^3).



Multivariate polynomials can be useful for modeling relationships between multiple variables. For example, a polynomial with two variables, such as 3x^2 + 2xy + y^2, could be used to model the relationship between two variables, such as the price and demand for a product.",1

 to the whole sequence. Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages. Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences (the property of digital infinity), language modeling faces the problem of assigning non-zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data. Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem, such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers.
Language models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics; from initial applications in speech recognition to ensure nonsensical (i.e. low-probability) word sequences are not predicted, to wider use in machine translation (e.g. scoring candidate translations), natural language generation (generating more human-like text), part-of-speech tagging, parsing, Optical Character Recognition, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, information retrieval, and other applications.
Language models are used in information retrieval in the query likelihood model. There, a separate language model is associated with each document in a collection. Documents are ranked based on the probability of the query Q in the document's language model

ai_645,"A language model is a statistical model that is used to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words. It assigns a probability to a sequence of words, indicating how likely it is that the sequence of words would occur in a given context. Language models are used in a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.



There are different types of language models, including character-based language models, word-based language models, and n-gram language models. Character-based language models predict the likelihood of a sequence of characters, while word-based language models predict the likelihood of a sequence of words. N-gram language models predict the likelihood of a sequence of words by considering the probability of each word in the sequence given the previous n-1 words.



Language models can be trained on large corpora of text data using techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation or neural network-based approaches. The goal of training a language model is to learn the statistical patterns and relationships that exist in the language, so that the model can make accurate predictions about the likelihood of different sequences of words.",1

ai_647,"An acoustic model is a statistical model that is used to represent the relationships between an audio signal and the linguistic content that the signal conveys. Acoustic models are commonly used in speech recognition systems, which are designed to transcribe spoken language into written text.



The acoustic model is one of the key components of a speech recognition system. It is responsible for mapping an audio signal to a sequence of words or phonemes (the basic units of sound in a language). To do this, the acoustic model uses a set of parameters that describe the characteristics of the audio signal, such as its pitch, duration, and spectral content. These parameters are derived from training data, which consists of a large collection of audio recordings and their corresponding transcriptions.



During the training process, the acoustic model is trained to recognize patterns in the audio signal that correspond to specific words or phonemes. This is typically done using a machine learning algorithm, such as a deep neural network. Once the acoustic model has been trained, it can be used to transcribe new audio signals by comparing the characteristics of the signal to the patterns it has learned from the training data.



Acoustic models are an important part of many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including speech-to-text systems, automatic translation systems, and speech synthesis systems. They are also used in other areas of audio signal processing, such as speaker recognition and music classification.",1
human_648,"Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems.[a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).
The theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.
Ridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.",0
ai_649,"Weight decay is a regularization technique used in machine learning and deep learning to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the weight values of the model. This penalty term is called the weight decay term, and it is typically multiplied by a hyperparameter called the weight decay rate or decay coefficient, which determines the strength of the regularization.



In practice, weight decay is often implemented by adding a term to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model weights. This term is the product of the weight decay rate and the weights themselves, and it is subtracted from the original gradient before the weights are updated. For example, in stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the weights are updated according to the following equation:



weights = weights - learning_rate * (gradient + weight_decay_rate * weights)



The effect of weight decay is to encourage the weights of the model to take smaller values, which can help to prevent overfitting. This is because smaller weights correspond to a simpler model, which is less likely to fit the noise in the training data.



Weight decay is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to further improve the generalization performance of the model. It is an important tool for improving the robustness and generalization of machine learning and deep learning models.",1
human_650,"In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m × n for an m × n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.
Conceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. For example, consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls were to have springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory and numerical analysis, which typically have a low density of significant data or connections. Large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.
When storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices, as they are common in the machine learning field. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeros. Sparse data is by nature more easily compressed and thus requires significantly less storage. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.",0
ai_651,"A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Sparse matrices are often used to represent large, sparse datasets because they can be stored and manipulated more efficiently than full matrices.



For example, consider a matrix with 10,000 rows and 10,000 columns, where only a small fraction of the elements are non-zero. Storing this matrix as a full matrix would require a large amount of memory, even though most of the elements are zero. By storing the matrix as a sparse matrix, we can save a lot of memory by only storing the non-zero elements and their positions.



Sparse matrices can be represented in a number of ways, such as a list of tuples, a dictionary of keys, or a coordinate list. There are also specialized data structures and algorithms for working with sparse matrices, which can be more efficient than using general-purpose matrix operations.



Sparse matrices are used in a wide range of applications, including scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. They are particularly useful when working with large, sparse datasets, as they can help to reduce the memory and computational overhead of storing and manipulating the data.",1
human_652,"In machine learning and statistics, the learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Since it influences to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information, it metaphorically represents the speed at which a machine learning model ""learns"". In the adaptive control literature, the learning rate is commonly referred to as gain.
In setting a learning rate, there is a trade-off between the rate of convergence and overshooting. While the descent direction is usually determined from the gradient of the loss function, the learning rate determines how big a step is taken in that direction. A too high learning rate will make the learning jump over minima but a too low learning rate will either take too long to converge or get stuck in an undesirable local minimum.
In order to achieve faster convergence, prevent oscillations and getting stuck in undesirable local minima the learning rate is often varied during training either in accordance to a learning rate schedule or by using an adaptive learning rate. The learning rate and its adjustments may also differ per parameter, in which case it is a diagonal matrix that can be interpreted as an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian matrix in Newton's method. The learning rate is related to the step length determined by inexact line search in quasi-Newton methods and related optimization algorithms.
When conducting line searches, mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) affect the characteristics of the loss function along which the learning rate needs to be resolved. Static MBSS keeps the mini-batch fixed along a search direction, resulting in a smooth loss function along the search direction. Dynamic MBSS updates the mini-batch at every function evaluation, resulting in a point-wise discontinuous loss function along the search direction. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for static MBSS loss functions include the parabolic approximation line (PAL) search. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for dynamic MBSS loss functions include probabilistic line searches,[10] gradient-only line searches (GOLS)[11] and quadratic approximations.[12]",0
ai_653,"In machine learning, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the optimizer makes updates to the model parameters. It is a key factor in the training process of a neural network, as it controls how fast or slow the model learns.



The learning rate is usually set before training the model and remains constant throughout the training process. A larger learning rate means that the model will make larger updates to the model parameters with each training step, while a smaller learning rate means that the updates will be smaller.



There are a few different approaches to setting the learning rate. One approach is to manually set the learning rate to a fixed value, but this can be difficult because the optimal learning rate can vary widely depending on the specific model and dataset. A more common approach is to use a learning rate schedule, which adjusts the learning rate over time based on the performance of the model. For example, the learning rate may start off high and then gradually decrease as training progresses.



It's important to choose an appropriate learning rate, as a learning rate that is too high can cause the model to diverge and a learning rate that is too low can make the training process slow and inefficient. Finding the right balance is key to successfully training a machine learning model.",1
human_654,"In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.
The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data.  The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss. Cross-validation is often used to estimate this generalization performance.",0
ai_655,"Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the optimal values for a model's hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a model, and they can greatly impact the performance of a model. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate for training a neural network, the number of layers and neurons in a network, the type of loss function to use, and the regularization strength.



Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in the process of building and training a machine learning model. Choosing the right hyperparameters can make a big difference in the accuracy and efficiency of a model. There are several methods that can be used to optimize hyperparameters, including manual tuning, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.



In manual tuning, the hyperparameters are selected by the practitioner based on their experience and knowledge of the problem. This can be time-consuming and may not always lead to the best results.



In grid search, the practitioner defines a grid of hyperparameter values and the model is trained and evaluated using each combination of values. This can be computationally expensive, especially for large grids and complex models.



In random search, the practitioner defines a distribution of hyperparameter values and a random set of values is drawn from this distribution for each iteration. This can be less computationally expensive than grid search, but it may not be as thorough.



Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian statistics to model the function being optimized and then selects the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate based on this model. This can be more efficient than grid search or random search, but it can be more complex to implement.",1

The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another.
Circuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated substrate (a printed circuit board or PCB) and solder the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit.

human_668,"The field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current in a semiconductor.

FETs are also known as unipolar transistors since they involve single-carrier-type operation. That is, FETs use either electrons (n-channel) or holes (p-channel) as charge carriers in their operation, but not both. Many different types of field effect transistors exist.

To perform computing tasks more quickly (or better in some other way), generally one can invest time and money in improving the software, improving the hardware, or both. There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market.

With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.[10] The disadvantage however, is that in many open source projects, it requires proprietary libraries that not all vendors are keen to distribute or expose, making it difficult to integrate in such projects.",0
ai_671,"A hardware accelerator is a specialized hardware device that performs a specific function or set of functions more efficiently than a general-purpose computer or processor. Hardware accelerators are used to improve the performance of certain tasks, particularly those that require high levels of processing power or are computationally intensive.



Hardware accelerators can be used in a variety of applications, including machine learning, scientific computing, video processing, and data compression. They can be standalone devices or integrated into other hardware, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU) or a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).



Hardware accelerators are designed to work in conjunction with a central processing unit (CPU), which handles the overall control and coordination of tasks within a computer system. The CPU offloads specific tasks to the hardware accelerator, which can then perform those tasks more efficiently and quickly than the CPU alone. This allows the system to operate more efficiently and can significantly improve the performance of certain tasks.



Examples of hardware accelerators include graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to render graphics and perform other tasks related to visual data; network interface controllers (NICs), which are used to improve the performance of network communication; and digital signal processors (DSPs), which are used to perform mathematical operations on digital signals.",1
human_672,"In optics, a frequency comb is a laser source whose spectrum consists of a series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media, or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to this last mechanism, which was developed around the turn of the 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch in 2005.
The frequency domain representation of a perfect frequency comb is a series of delta functions spaced according to

ai_673,"A frequency comb is a device that generates a series of equally spaced frequencies, or a spectrum of frequencies that is periodic in the frequency domain. The spacing between the frequencies is called the comb spacing, and it is typically on the order of a few megahertz or gigahertz. The name ""frequency comb"" comes from the fact that the spectrum of frequencies generated by the device looks like the teeth of a comb when plotted on a frequency axis.



Frequency combs are important tools in a variety of scientific and technological applications. They are used, for example, in precision spectroscopy, metrology, and telecommunications. They can also be used to generate ultra-short optical pulses, which have many applications in fields such as nonlinear optics and precision measurement.



There are several different ways to generate a frequency comb, but one of the most common methods is to use a mode-locked laser. Mode-locking is a technique in which the laser cavity is actively stabilized, resulting in the emission of a series of very short, equally spaced pulses of light. The spectrum of each pulse is a frequency comb, with the comb spacing determined by the repetition rate of the pulses. Other methods for generating frequency combs include electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical processes, and microresonator systems.",1
human_674,"A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) or integrated optical circuit is a microchip containing two or more photonic components which form a functioning circuit. This technology detects, generates, transports, and processes light. Photonic integrated circuits utilize photons (or particles of light) as opposed to electrons that are utilized by electronic integrated circuits. The major difference between the two is that a photonic integrated circuit provides functions for information signals imposed on optical wavelengths typically in the visible spectrum or near infrared (850–1650 nm).
The most commercially utilized material platform for photonic integrated circuits is indium phosphide (InP), which allows for the integration of various optically active and passive functions on the same chip. Initial examples of photonic integrated circuits were simple 2-section distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, consisting of two independently controlled device sections – a gain section and a DBR mirror section. Consequently, all modern monolithic tunable lasers, widely tunable lasers, externally modulated lasers and transmitters, integrated receivers, etc. are examples of photonic integrated circuits. As of 2012, devices integrate hundreds of functions onto a single chip.  
Pioneering work in this arena was performed at Bell Laboratories. The most notable academic centers of excellence of photonic integrated circuits in InP are the University of California at Santa Barbara, USA, the Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

human_684,"In natural language processing (NLP), word embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Word embeddings can be obtained using a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.
Methods to generate this mapping include neural networks, dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, probabilistic models, explainable knowledge base method, and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.
Word and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.[10]",0
ai_685,"Word embedding is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from a vocabulary are mapped to dense vectors of real numbers. The idea behind word embeddings is to represent words in a continuous, numerical space so that the distance between words is meaningful and captures some of the relationships between them. This can be useful for various NLP tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and text classification, among others.



There are several ways to obtain word embeddings, but one common approach is to use a neural network to learn the embeddings from large amounts of text data. The neural network is trained to predict the context of a target word, given a window of surrounding words. The embedding for each word is learned as the weights of the hidden layer of the network.



Word embeddings have several advantages over traditional techniques such as one-hot encoding, which represents each word as a binary vector with a 1 in the position corresponding to the word and 0s elsewhere. One-hot encoded vectors are high-dimensional and sparse, which can be inefficient for some NLP tasks. In contrast, word embeddings are lower-dimensional and dense, which makes them more efficient to work with and can capture relationships between words that one-hot encoding cannot.",1
human_686,"In mathematics and physics, a vector space (also called a linear space) is a set whose elements, often called vectors, may be added together and multiplied (""scaled"") by numbers called scalars. Scalars are often real numbers, but can be  complex numbers or, more generally, elements of any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. The terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used to specify the nature of the scalars: real coordinate space or complex coordinate space.
Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities, such as forces and velocity, that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrix, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.
Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is finite-dimensional if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.
Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures. This is the case of algebras, which include field extensions, polynomial rings, associative algebras and Lie algebras. This is also the case of topological vector spaces, which include function spaces, inner product spaces, normed spaces, Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.",0

The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below. These axioms enable one to derive many of the fundamental results of linear algebra.



A vector space over a field F (often referred to as a vector space over F, or just a vector space if the field is understood) is a set V together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.



Addition: V is an abelian group under the binary operation of vector addition.

Scalar multiplication: For all v in V and all c in F, the scalar-vector product cv is a member of V.

Distributive laws: For all u and v in V and all c in F, the following hold:

a. (c + d)v = cv + dv

b. c(u + v) = cu + cv

c. (cd)v = c(dv) = d(cv)

Additive identity: There exists a zero vector 0 in V such that for all v in V, v + 0 = v.

Additive inverse: For all v in V, there exists an element −v in V such that v + (−v) = 0.

Multiplicative identity: For all v in V, 1v = v.

One common way to create sentence embeddings is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to pre-process the sentence, and then use a machine learning model, such as a neural network, to learn a numerical representation of the sentence based on its structure and content. The resulting vector can then be used as input to other machine learning models, such as for text classification or clustering.

human_689,Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is a method of machine translation often characterized by its use of a bilingual corpus with parallel texts as its main knowledge base at run-time. It is essentially a translation by analogy and can be viewed as an implementation of a case-based reasoning approach to machine learning.,0
ai_690,"Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is a type of machine translation (MT) that relies on a database of translated sentence pairs to translate new text. The basic idea behind EBMT is that it can use these examples as a reference to guide the translation of new text, by finding similar examples in the database and adapting them to fit the new text.



To use EBMT, the system first builds a database of translated sentence pairs, which can be obtained through manual translation or machine translation. The database is then used as a reference for translating new text. When a new sentence needs to be translated, the system searches the database for examples that are similar to the new sentence and uses them as a reference to generate a translation.



EBMT is a relatively simple and fast method of machine translation, but it has some limitations. One limitation is that it relies on the availability of good quality, relevant examples in the database, which may not always be the case. Additionally, EBMT can struggle to handle text that is significantly different from the examples in the database, or text that contains words or phrases that are not present in the database.



Overall, EBMT can be a useful tool for machine translation, particularly in situations where there is a limited amount of text to be translated and the quality of the translation is not critical. However, it may not be the best choice for translation tasks that require a high level of accuracy or for translating text that is significantly different from the examples in the database.",1

Four of the six known ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD, and was the cause of the 2013–2016 epidemic in western Africa, which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths.
Ebola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new ""strain"" of the closely related Marburg virus. The virus was renamed ""Ebola virus"" in 2010 to avoid confusion. Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus, which is assigned to the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The members of the species are called Zaire ebolaviruses. The natural reservoir of Ebola virus is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans through body fluids.
The EBOV genome is a single-stranded RNA, approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).[10]
Because of its high fatality rate (up to 83 to 90 percent),[11][12] EBOV is also listed as a select agent, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), a US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, US CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group.[citation needed]",0

The Ebola virus is named after the Ebola River, which is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Africa, where the virus was first identified in 1976.



The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected animals, such as bats, primates, or humans. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, breastfeeding, or the reuse of needles and syringes contaminated with the virus.



Symptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) typically appear within 2 to 21 days after infection, although it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear. Early symptoms of EVD may include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. As the disease progresses, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and external bleeding from the eyes, ears, and nose. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death.



There is no specific treatment for EVD, and the virus has a high mortality rate.

For example, the term ""enzyme activity"" is a more general term that includes more specific terms like ""kinase activity"" and ""phosphatase activity."" This hierarchical structure allows for a consistent and systematic way of annotating and organizing gene functions.



GO is used by researchers to annotate and classify genes in order to understand their functions and roles in different biological processes. It is a widely used resource in the field of bioinformatics and is often used in conjunction with other databases and tools to analyze and interpret large-scale genomic data.",1
human_701,"An  electronic health record (EHR) is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically stored health information in a digital format. These records can be shared across different health care settings. Records are shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges. EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.
For several decades, electronic health records (EHRs) have been touted as key to increasing of quality care. Electronic health records are used for other reasons than charting for patients; today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs. EHR combines all patients demographics into a large pool, and uses this information to assist with the creation of ""new treatments or innovation in healthcare delivery"" which overall improves the goals in healthcare. Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system's health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients. EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients.
EHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time. It eliminates the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is up-to-date, accurate and legible. It also allows open communication between the patient and the provider, while providing ""privacy and security."" It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date and decreases risk of lost paperwork and is cost efficient. Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical records) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient. Population-based studies of medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs.",0

EHRs are designed to be shared among a patient's healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurses, and other clinicians. This allows all members of a patient's healthcare team to have access to the most up-to-date information about the patient's health, which can help improve the quality and efficiency of care.



EHRs also have a number of other benefits, such as:



Improved patient safety: EHRs can reduce the risk of medical errors by providing a complete and accurate record of a patient's health history, which can help avoid harmful drug interactions or duplicate tests.



Better coordination of care: EHRs can help healthcare providers coordinate care by allowing them to easily share information with other members of the healthcare team, such as specialists or primary care doctors.



Increased efficiency: EHRs can save time by eliminating the need for manual charting and reducing the need for paper records.



Enhanced patient engagement: Some EHRs allow patients to access their own health records and communicate with their healthcare providers through secure portals. This can help patients take a more active role in their own healthcare.",1

human_705,"An inverse problem in science is the process of calculating from a set of observations the causal factors that produced them: for example, calculating an image in X-ray computed tomography, source reconstruction in acoustics, or calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of its gravity field. It is called an inverse problem because it starts with the effects and then calculates the causes. It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.
Inverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in science and mathematics because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They have wide application in system identification, optics, radar, acoustics, communication theory, signal processing, medical imaging, computer vision, geophysics, oceanography, astronomy, remote sensing, natural language processing, machine learning, nondestructive testing, slope stability analysis and many other fields.[citation needed]",0
ai_706,"Inverse problems are problems in which the goal is to determine some property or properties of an object or system from observations or measurements of another related property or properties. Inverse problems often arise in science and engineering, where they are used to infer information about the internal structure, composition, or behavior of an object or system from external observations or measurements.



For example, in geophysics, inverse problems are used to infer the composition and structure of the Earth's interior from measurements of its gravitational and magnetic fields. In medical imaging, inverse problems are used to reconstruct images of internal organs or tissues from measurements taken by imaging modalities such as CT scans or MRI. In electrical engineering, inverse problems are used to determine the electrical properties of materials or devices from measurements of their electrical response.

The first examples date from the early 20th century, but colorization has become common with the advent of digital image processing.",0
ai_708,"Film colorization is the process of adding color to a black and white, grayscale, or partially colorized film or video. This can be done manually or using computer software, and the goal is to create a version of the film or video that looks as if it was originally shot in color.



There are several different techniques that can be used for film colorization, including hand-painting each frame of the film, using a specialized computer software to automatically colorize the film, or using a combination of both techniques.



Some people argue that film colorization can enhance the viewing experience by adding visual interest and making the film more appealing to modern audiences. Others believe that colorization can diminish the historical and artistic value of a black and white film, and that the original version should be preserved as it was originally intended.



Regardless of one's personal opinion on the matter, it is important to note that film colorization is a controversial and divisive issue, and that it is ultimately up to the creators of the film or the owner of the rights to decide whether or not to colorize it.",1

ai_710,"Deep Image Prior is a method for image restoration and inpainting that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the prior, or underlying assumption, for the solution to an inverse problem. It was proposed by Dmitry Ulyanov and his colleagues in a paper published in 2017.



The idea behind Deep Image Prior is that the structure and features present in natural images can be used to guide the restoration of a damaged or degraded image. To do this, the authors trained a CNN on a large dataset of natural images and then used the trained network as a prior for solving inverse problems, such as image denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting.



One of the key benefits of Deep Image Prior is that it can be used to restore images without the need for any training data. This is in contrast to traditional image restoration methods, which often require large amounts of training data to learn the relationships between the input and output images. Instead, Deep Image Prior relies on the inherent structure and features present in natural images, which are captured by the CNN, to guide the restoration process.



Overall, Deep Image Prior is a promising approach for image restoration and inpainting, as it can produce high-quality results with minimal training data and can be used for a wide range of inverse problems.",1

human_713,"In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.
The function is often thought of as an ""unknown"" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability.[citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.
Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.
Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no ""general theory"" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.
Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the ""PDE"" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.",0
ai_714,"A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that involves partial derivatives of a function with respect to two or more independent variables. PDEs are used to describe the behavior of many different physical systems, including fluid flow, heat transfer, and the vibration of structures.



An example of a partial differential equation is the heat equation, which describes how the temperature of a solid object changes over time. The heat equation is written as:



∂T/∂t = κ ∂^2T/∂x^2



Here, T is the temperature of the object at a given point in space and time, t is time, x is the position in space, and κ is a constant known as the thermal diffusivity. The partial derivative ∂T/∂t represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time, and the second partial derivative ∂^2T/∂x^2 represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to space.



PDEs are used to model a wide range of phenomena, from the movement of fluids to the distribution of electricity in a circuit. They are an important tool in many areas of science and engineering, and are typically solved using numerical methods or analytical techniques.",1
human_715,"In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/ nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes).
The Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier–Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier–Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).
The Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.
The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions—i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain. This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1 million prize for a solution or a counterexample.",0
ai_716,"The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids, such as gases and liquids. They are named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish scientist George Gabriel Stokes.

They are used to predict the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications, including aerodynamics, meteorology, and the design of airplane wings and engines, as well as the flow of blood in the human body and the behavior of oceans and rivers.



The Navier-Stokes equations are based on the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. They take the form of a set of coupled partial differential equations that must be solved simultaneously in order to accurately predict the motion of a fluid.



Solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a challenging task, and it is an active area of research in mathematics and engineering. Despite their widespread use and importance, there are still many aspects of fluid dynamics that are not fully understood and that remain the subject of ongoing research.",1
human_717,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows.  Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid (liquids and gases) with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels.

ai_719,"The term ""ageing clock"" refers to the concept that there is a biological clock or process that determines the rate at which an organism ages. This is often used to explain why some organisms live longer than others, or why some people seem to age more quickly or slowly than others.



There is evidence to suggest that ageing is influenced by a number of factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices. Some scientists believe that the ageing process is regulated by certain genes that control the rate at which cells divide and repair themselves, and that these genes may be responsible for the differences in lifespan and ageing rate that we observe in different species and individuals.



While the concept of an ""ageing clock"" is still the subject of much research and debate, it is generally accepted that the rate of ageing is not fixed and can be influenced by a variety of factors. Some studies have suggested that interventions such as diet and exercise may be able to slow the ageing process, while others have found that certain genetic mutations or treatments may be able to extend lifespan.",1
human_720,"Biomarkers of aging are biomarkers that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than chronological age. Stated another way, biomarkers of aging would give the true ""biological age"", which may be different from the chronological age.
Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to extend lifespan, because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.  Although maximum lifespan would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because longitudinal studies would take far too much time.  Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of aging and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism. An assemblage of biomarker data for an organism could be termed its ""ageotype"".
Although graying of hair increases with age, hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. Biogerontologists have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.
Advances in big data analysis allowed for the new types of ""aging clocks"" to be developed. The epigenetic clock is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age. Further studies of the hematological clock on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality.
It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the transcriptomic clock.
The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. 
Consequently, modern deep machine learning techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently  large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the NHANES study).[10]",0

IBD also occurs in dogs and is thought to arise from a combination of host genetics, intestinal microenvironment, environmental components and the immune system. There is an ongoing discussion, however, that the term ""chronic enteropathy"" might be better to use than ""inflammatory bowel disease"" in dogs because it differs from IBD in humans in how the dogs respond to treatment.

Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough. After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in dogs, intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation is occurring (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or granulomatous).

During fetal development, the brain starts to form within the first few weeks of pregnancy. At this stage, the brain is made up of three primary regions: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. These regions differentiate and grow at different rates, and each plays a different role in the development of the brain and the body.



After birth, the brain continues to develop and change. The brain undergoes a period of rapid growth during the first few years of life, during which time new connections between neurons, or brain cells, are formed. This process, known as neuroplasticity, allows the brain to adapt and change in response to new experiences.



During childhood and adolescence, the brain continues to mature and develop. This process involves the strengthening of connections between neurons, the development of new neurons, and the strengthening and pruning of synapses, which are the connections between neurons.

These damages change the neural circuits in the brain and cause it to malfunction during basic cognitive processes, such as memory or learning. People have learning disabilities and such damage, can be compared with how the healthy neural circuits are functioning, and possibly draw conclusions about the basis of the affected cognitive processes. Some examples of learning disabilities in the brain include places in Wernicke's area, the left side of the temporal lobe, and Brocca's area close to the frontal lobe.

human_730,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor and neuropeptide primarily involved in the regulation of growth, maintenance, proliferation, and survival of certain target neurons. It is perhaps the prototypical growth factor, in that it was one of the first to be described. Since it was first isolated by Nobel Laureates Rita Levi-Montalcini and Stanley Cohen in 1956, numerous biological processes involving NGF have been identified, two of them being the survival of pancreatic beta cells and the regulation of the immune system.",0
ai_731,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the body. It is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which also includes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3).



NGF is produced by various cells in the body, including nerve cells, glial cells (non-neuronal cells that support and protect neurons), and certain immune cells. It acts on specific receptors (proteins that bind to specific signaling molecules and transmit the signal into cells) on the surface of neurons, activating signaling pathways that promote the growth and survival of these cells.



NGF is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including the development and maintenance of the nervous system, the regulation of pain sensitivity, and the response to nerve injury. It also plays a role in certain pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.



NGF has been the subject of intense research in recent years due to its potential therapeutic applications in a variety of diseases and conditions. For example, NGF has been investigated as a potential treatment for neuropathic pain, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, among others. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of NGF in these and other conditions, and to determine the safety and effectiveness of NGF-based therapies.",1
human_732,"In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a system which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is ""opaque"" (black). The term can be used to refer to many inner workings, such as those of a transistor, an engine, an algorithm, the human brain, or an institution or government.
To analyse an open system with a typical ""black box approach"", only the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) box. The usual representation of this black box system  is a data flow diagram centered in the box.
The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a white box (sometimes also known as a ""clear box"" or a ""glass box"").",0
ai_733,"A black box is a system, device, or process that can be studied or analyzed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings. The term ""black box"" is often used to describe systems or processes that are complex, or whose inner workings are not well understood or are hidden from the observer.



In the context of science and engineering, a black box is a device or system that can be observed in terms of its inputs and outputs, but the internal workings of the system are not known or are not accessible to the observer. For example, a computer program might be considered a black box if the programmer does not have access to the source code or the program's internal algorithms. In this case, the programmer can only study the program by running it and observing its inputs and outputs.



In the context of decision-making, a black box might refer to a decision-making process that is not transparent or that is not fully understood by the people involved. For example, a complex decision-making process in a corporation might be considered a black box if the people involved in the process do not have a clear understanding of how the decisions are made or what factors are considered.



Overall, the term ""black box"" can be used to describe any system or process that is difficult to understand or analyze due to its complexity or lack of transparency.",1
human_734,"Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive inferences. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises ""all men are mortal"" and ""Socrates is a man"" to the conclusion ""Socrates is mortal"" is deductively valid. An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true. Some theorists define deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. 
Psychology is interested in deductive reasoning as a psychological process, i.e. how people actually draw inferences. Logic, on the other hand, focuses on the deductive relation of logical consequence between the premises and the conclusion or how people should draw inferences. There are different ways of conceptualizing this relation. According to the semantic approach, an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation of this argument where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The syntactic approach, on the other hand, holds that an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference. A rule of inference is a schema of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their logical form. There are various rules of inference, like the modus ponens and the modus tollens. Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called formal fallacies. Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast to strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion. Deductive reasoning contrasts with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. For ampliative arguments, like inductive or abductive arguments, the premises offer weaker support to their conclusion: they make it more likely but they do not guarantee its truth. They make up for this drawback by being able to provide genuinely new information not already found in the premises, unlike deductive arguments.
Cognitive psychology investigates the mental processes responsible for deductive reasoning. One of its topics concerns the factors determining whether people draw valid or invalid deductive inferences. One factor is the form of the argument: for example, people are more successful for arguments of the form modus ponens than for modus tollens. Another is the content of the arguments: people are more likely to believe that an argument is valid if the claim made in its conclusion is plausible. A general finding is that people tend to perform better for realistic and concrete cases than for abstract cases. Psychological theories of deductive reasoning aim to explain these findings by providing an account of the underlying psychological processes. Mental logic theories hold that deductive reasoning is a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations using rules of inference. Mental model theories, on the other hand, claim that deductive reasoning involves models of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. According to dual-process theories of reasoning, there are two qualitatively different cognitive systems responsible for reasoning.
The problem of deductive reasoning is relevant to various fields and issues. Epistemology tries to understand how justification is transferred from the belief in the premises to the belief in the conclusion in the process of deductive reasoning. Probability logic studies how the probability of the premises of an inference affects the probability of its conclusion. The controversial thesis of deductivism denies that there are other correct forms of inference besides deduction. Natural deduction is a type of proof system based on simple and self-evident rules of inference. In philosophy, the geometrical method is a way of philosophizing that starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system using deductive reasoning.",0
ai_735,"Deductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking in which a conclusion is drawn based on the relationship between two or more premises. This type of reasoning starts with a general statement, or premise, and applies it to a specific situation to arrive at a logical conclusion.



For example, consider the following argument:



Premise 1: All birds can fly.

Premise 2: Eagles are birds.

Conclusion: Therefore, eagles can fly.



In this example, the conclusion that eagles can fly is drawn based on the relationship between the two premises: that all birds can fly and that eagles are birds. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.



Deductive reasoning is often contrasted with inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions based on observations or specific examples. While deductive reasoning is a reliable method for arriving at conclusions when the premises are true, it is not always possible to determine the truth of the premises with certainty. In such cases, the conclusion may not necessarily be reliable.",1
human_736,"The Guardian is a British daily newspaper. It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, and changed its name in 1959. Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust. The trust was created in 1936 to ""secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference"". The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.
The editor-in-chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015.[10][11] Since 2018, the paper's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format. As of July 2021[update], its print edition had a daily circulation of 105,134. The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as two international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013) and Guardian US (founded in 2011). The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion,[12][13] and the term ""Guardian reader"" is used to imply a stereotype of liberal, left-wing or ""politically correct"" views. Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the ""Grauniad"" in the 1960s, a nickname still used occasionally by the editors for self-mockery.[14]
In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public's trust of specific titles online, The Guardian scored highest for digital-content news, with 84% of readers agreeing that they ""trust what [they] see in it"".[15] A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper's print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018. It was also reported to be the most-read of the UK's ""quality newsbrands"", including digital editions; other ""quality"" brands included The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and the i. While The Guardian's print circulation is in decline, the report indicated that news from The Guardian, including that reported online, reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month.[16]
Chief among the notable ""scoops"" obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone-hacking scandal—and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler's phone.[17] The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World, the UK's best-selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in history.[18] In June 2013, The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records,[19] and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.[20] In 2016, The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers, exposing then–Prime Minister David Cameron's links to offshore bank accounts.

ai_740,"Grammar induction is the process of automatically learning the grammar of a language from a set of examples. It is a type of machine learning task that is often used in natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and understand natural language text or speech.



In grammar induction, a model is trained on a large dataset of text written in the language of interest. The model then uses this training data to learn the rules and structure of the language, including the syntax (the way words are arranged to form phrases and sentences) and the semantics (the meaning of words and phrases). Once trained, the model can then be used to analyze new text and identify its structure and meaning.



Grammar induction is a challenging task because languages are complex and have many rules and exceptions. However, advances in machine learning techniques have made it possible to build highly accurate grammar induction models that can analyze and understand natural language with a high degree of accuracy. These models can be used in a variety of applications, such as language translation, text classification, and information extraction.",1

human_743,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs. The Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University Press defines artificial intelligence as:
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require ""intelligence"" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an ""AI winter""), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[10] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[10][11]
The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[12] To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques – including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence ""can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"".[b]
This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[14] Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.[c]",0

Psychedelic art often aims to replicate the hallucinations and altered states of consciousness that can be experienced while under the influence of these drugs. It may also be used to express ideas and experiences related to spirituality, consciousness, and the nature of reality.



Psychedelic art is typically characterized by bold, colorful patterns and imagery that is intended to be visually appealing and sometimes disorienting. It often incorporates elements of surrealism and is inspired by Eastern spiritual and mystical traditions.

Here's how it works:



A population of potential solutions to a problem is created. These solutions are called ""chromosomes.""



Each chromosome is evaluated using a fitness function, which measures how well the solution solves the problem.



The chromosomes with the highest fitness scores are selected to be the ""parents"" for the next generation.



The selected parents undergo a process called ""crossover,"" in which their genetic material is combined to create new offspring chromosomes.



The new offspring chromosomes may also undergo a process called ""mutation,"" in which random changes are made to their genetic material.



The process is repeated, with the new generation of chromosomes being evaluated and selected as parents for the next generation, until a satisfactory solution is found or a predetermined number of generations has been reached.



Genetic algorithms are often used to solve complex optimization problems where traditional search algorithms may be insufficient. They are useful because they can find good solutions even when the problem is not fully understood and can be implemented relatively easily.

human_756,"Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.
The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.
The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]
The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

human_762,"Email filtering is the processing of email to organize it according to specified criteria. The term can apply to the intervention of human intelligence, but most often refers to the automatic processing of messages at an SMTP server, possibly applying anti-spam techniques. Filtering can be applied to incoming emails as well as to outgoing ones.
Depending on the calling environment, email filtering software can reject an item at the initial SMTP connection stage or pass it through unchanged for delivery to the user's mailbox.  It is also possible to redirect the message for delivery elsewhere, quarantine it for further checking, modify it or 'tag' it in any other way.",0
ai_763,"Email filtering is the process of automatically identifying and sorting incoming emails based on specified criteria. Filtering can be used to classify emails as spam, to organize emails into folders or labels, or to automatically delete certain emails.



Email filters are typically created and managed by the user, and can be based on various criteria such as the sender, the recipient, the subject line, the content of the email, or attachments. For example, a user might create a filter to automatically move all emails from a specific sender to a specific folder, or to delete all emails with certain keywords in the subject line.



Email filters are commonly used to reduce the amount of spam or unwanted emails that a user receives, and to help organize and prioritize emails. Many email clients and webmail services include built-in email filtering functionality, and users can also use third-party email filtering tools to enhance their email management.",1
human_764,"Computational statistics, or statistical computing, is the bond between statistics and computer science. It means statistical methods that are enabled by using computational methods. It is the area of computational science (or scientific computing) specific to the mathematical science of statistics. This area is also developing rapidly, leading to calls that a broader concept of computing should be taught as part of general statistical education.
As in traditional statistics the goal is to transform raw data into knowledge, but the focus lies on computer intensive statistical methods, such as cases with very large sample size and non-homogeneous data sets.
The terms 'computational statistics' and 'statistical computing' are often used interchangeably, although Carlo Lauro (a former president of the International Association for Statistical Computing) proposed making a distinction, defining 'statistical computing' as ""the application of computer science to statistics"",
and 'computational statistics' as ""aiming at the design of algorithm for implementing
statistical methods on computers, including the ones unthinkable before the computer
age (e.g. bootstrap, simulation), as well as to cope with analytically intractable problems"" [sic].
The term 'Computational statistics' may also be used to refer to computationally intensive statistical methods including resampling methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, local regression, kernel density estimation, artificial neural networks and generalized additive models.",0
ai_765,"Computational statistics is a field of study that combines statistical methods with computational techniques to analyze and solve problems in statistical data analysis. It involves the use of computer algorithms and software to analyze large datasets, perform statistical simulations, and optimize statistical models.



In computational statistics, statistical models are often used to describe patterns in data and to make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. These models may be used to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes, to test hypotheses about relationships between variables, or to estimate the values of unknown parameters.



Computational techniques are used to fit statistical models to data, perform statistical tests, and estimate uncertainty or error in the results. These techniques may include algorithms for optimization, sampling, or simulation, as well as methods for dealing with missing or incomplete data.



Computational statistics is a rapidly growing field, with many applications in a wide range of fields, including finance, biology, engineering, and the social sciences. It is an important tool for researchers and practitioners who need to analyze large and complex datasets and make informed decisions based on the results.",1
human_766,"Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.
The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.
The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]
The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.",0

A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing. Exploratory data analysis has been promoted by John Tukey since 1970 to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed.

EDA typically involves a number of different techniques, including visualizing the data using plots and charts, calculating summary statistics, and identifying trends and patterns using statistical tests and other methods. It is typically an iterative process, as the insights gained from one analysis can often lead to further questions and additional analyses.



EDA is an important tool for understanding and interpreting data, and it can be used in a wide range of applications, including scientific research, business analysis, and policy making. It can help to identify trends and patterns in the data that may not be immediately obvious, and it can help to identify potential issues or problems with the data that need to be addressed before more advanced analyses are performed.",1
human_770,"Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from data mining, predictive modeling, and machine learning that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events.
In business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of conditions, guiding decision-making for candidate transactions.
The defining functional effect of these technical approaches is that predictive analytics provides a predictive score (probability) for each individual (customer, employee, healthcare patient, product SKU, vehicle, component, machine, or other organizational unit) in order to determine, inform, or influence organizational processes that pertain across large numbers of individuals, such as in marketing, credit risk assessment, fraud detection, manufacturing, healthcare, and government operations including law enforcement.",0

What belongs to a family—or if a described family should be recognized at all—are proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists. There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family, but in plants, they can be characterized on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features of plant species. Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions, and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time.

human_774,"The black swan theory or theory of black swan events is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. The term is based on an ancient saying that presumed black swans did not exist –  a saying that became reinterpreted to teach a different lesson after they were discovered in Australia.
The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, starting in 2001, to explain:
Taleb's ""black swan theory"" refers only to unexpected events of large magnitude and consequence and their dominant role in history. Such events, considered extreme outliers, collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences.: xxi  More technically, in the scientific monograph ""Silent Risk"", Taleb mathematically defines the black swan problem as ""stemming from the use of degenerate metaprobability"".",0
ai_775,"The black swan theory is a concept in risk management that refers to events or occurrences that are unexpected and have a significant impact. The term is derived from the metaphor of a black swan, which refers to a hypothetical event that is unexpected and has a significant impact, but is also retrospectively explainable.



The black swan theory was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book ""The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,"" in which he argues that black swan events are not only highly impactful, but also difficult to predict or anticipate. According to Taleb, black swan events are characterized by their rarity, their extreme impact, and the fact that they are often only explainable in hindsight.



The black swan theory has important implications for risk management and decision-making, as it suggests that we should be prepared for and able to adapt to unexpected and potentially catastrophic events. It also highlights the importance of being aware of our own biases and limitations when it comes to predicting and managing risk, and the need to be open to the possibility that events or outcomes that we consider unlikely or impossible may actually occur.",1

human_778,"A personal computer game, also known as a PC game or computer game, is a type of video game played on a personal computer (PC) rather than a video game console or arcade machine. Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video and audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, and now its lack of physical media, make precisely assessing its size difficult. In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.
Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983, leading to the era of the ""bedroom coder"". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass-market traction to console games, before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution on services such as Steam and GOG.com.

Academic disciplines are conventionally divided into the humanities, including language, art and cultural studies, and the scientific disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, and biology; the social sciences are sometimes considered a third category.
Individuals associated with academic disciplines are commonly referred to as experts or specialists. Others, who may have studied liberal arts or systems theory rather than concentrating in a specific academic discipline, are classified as generalists.

The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.
Generalized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. They proposed an iteratively reweighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters. MLE remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages. Other approaches, including Bayesian regression and least squares fitting to variance stabilized responses, have been developed.",0
ai_791,"A generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible statistical model that can be used to analyze a wide range of data types. It is an extension of the linear regression model, which is used to model the relationship between a continuous response variable and one or more predictor variables.



The key difference between a linear regression model and a GLM is that in a GLM, the response variable is not necessarily continuous and may follow a different distribution, such as a binomial, poisson, or gamma distribution. The GLM allows for the modeling of this type of data by using a link function to relate the mean of the response variable to a linear combination of the predictor variables.



In a GLM, the response variable is assumed to follow a certain distribution, and the mean of this distribution is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables. The parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the data, which is the probability of observing the data given the model.



Examples of GLMs include logistic regression for modeling binary data, Poisson regression for modeling count data, and gamma regression for modeling continuous data with a positive skew.",1

It is a common technique used in fields such as economics, finance, engineering, and the natural and social sciences.



Probabilistic reasoning involves using probabilities, which are numerical measures of the likelihood of an event occurring. Probabilities can range from 0, which indicates that an event is impossible, to 1, which indicates that an event is certain to occur. Probabilities can also be expressed as percentages or fractions.



Probabilistic reasoning can involve calculating the probability of a single event occurring, or it can involve calculating the probability of multiple events occurring simultaneously or in sequence.

human_794,"Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.
CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.
CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.
Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.
Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",0
ai_795,"Automated medical diagnosis is the use of computer algorithms and software to analyze medical data and provide a diagnosis without the need for human intervention. This can include analyzing medical images, such as x-rays or CT scans, analyzing electronic health records (EHRs), and using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and make predictions based on the data.



There are several potential benefits to automated medical diagnosis. One benefit is that it can help to reduce the workload of doctors and other healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks and patient care. Automated diagnosis can also be faster and more accurate than human diagnosis, particularly in cases where there is a large volume of data to analyze or where the diagnosis requires specialized expertise. Additionally, automated diagnosis can help to reduce the risk of errors and improve patient safety.



However, there are also some limitations to automated medical diagnosis. One limitation is that it may not always be possible to fully automate the diagnostic process, particularly in cases where the diagnosis requires a detailed understanding of the patient's medical history or a thorough physical examination. Additionally, automated diagnosis may not always be able to account for all of the factors that can affect a patient's health, such as social, environmental, and psychological factors. Finally, automated diagnosis may not be able to provide the same level of personalized care and attention that a human healthcare professional can offer.",1
human_796,"Geoffrey Everest Hinton CC FRS FRSC[11] (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. Since 2013, he has divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto. In 2017, he co-founded and became the Chief Scientific Advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.[12][13]
With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks,[14] although they were not the first to propose the approach.[15] Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community.[16][17][18][19][20] The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky[21] and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012[22] was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.[23]
Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning.[24] They are sometimes referred to as the ""Godfathers of AI"" and ""Godfathers of Deep Learning"",[25][26] and have continued to give public talks together.[27][28]",0

human_798,"In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.
Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. 
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]
Neural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]",0
ai_799,"Symbolic artificial intelligence (also known as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned artificial intelligence"" (GOFAI)) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and reasoning to solve problems. It involves representing knowledge about the world in the form of symbols and using logical rules to manipulate these symbols to perform tasks such as problem-solving, planning, and decision-making.



Symbolic AI systems are designed to represent and reason with explicit, declarative knowledge, which is knowledge that can be expressed in a symbolic form and can be manipulated and processed by a computer. These systems use logical rules and symbolic representations to represent knowledge and to make inferences about the world. They rely on pre-defined rules and logical reasoning to solve problems and make decisions, rather than learning from data or experience like some other approaches to artificial intelligence.



One of the key advantages of symbolic AI is that it allows for the explicit representation of complex knowledge and logical reasoning. This can be useful in situations where there are clear rules and logical relationships between different pieces of information, and where it is important to be able to explain the reasoning behind a decision. However, symbolic AI can be limited in its ability to deal with the complexity and uncertainty of real-world situations, and it may struggle with tasks that require more flexible or creative problem-solving approaches.",1
human_800,"Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.
Central subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).
Although it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.
As a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation. A great discovery of twentieth-century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.",0
ai_801,"Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence. It is used to model and analyze uncertain situations, such as the outcome of a coin toss or the outcome of a medical trial.



In probability theory, events are assigned probabilities, which are numerical values that reflect the likelihood of the event occurring. These probabilities are typically expressed as decimal values between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a certain event. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it landing on heads is 0.5, because there is an equal chance of either outcome occurring.



Probability theory is used in a wide range of fields, including finance, engineering, and the natural and social sciences. It is a fundamental tool for making decisions under uncertainty and for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems.",1

human_804,"Knowledge extraction is the creation of knowledge from structured (relational databases, XML) and unstructured (text, documents, images) sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to information extraction (NLP) and ETL (data warehouse), the main criterion is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a relational schema. It requires either the reuse of existing formal knowledge (reusing identifiers or ontologies) or the generation of a schema based on the source data.

human_807,"In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function)  is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some ""cost"" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.
In statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.",0
ai_808,"A loss function is a mathematical function that maps a set of predictions and their corresponding true values to a real number that represents the cost or penalty associated with the predictions.

There are many different types of loss functions, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific problem being addressed. For example, in a classification task, the cross-entropy loss is often used, while in a regression task, the mean squared error (MSE) loss is often used.



The loss function is an essential component of a machine learning model because it helps the model learn to make accurate predictions by providing a measure of how well the model's predictions match the true values. The model can then use this measure to adjust its internal parameters in an attempt to minimize the loss and improve its predictions.",1

Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population. In machine learning, the term inference is sometimes used instead to mean ""make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model""; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as training or learning (rather than inference), and using a model for prediction is referred to as inference (instead of prediction); see also predictive inference.",0

In survey sampling, weights can be applied to the data to adjust for the sample design, particularly in stratified sampling.

One key property of a sample is that it is representative of the population. This means that the sample should be similar to the population in terms of important characteristics such as age, gender, education level, and income.

human_817,"Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.: 587–588  Random forests generally outperform decision trees, but their accuracy is lower than gradient boosted trees.[citation needed] However, data characteristics can affect their performance.
The first algorithm for random decision forests was created in 1995 by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the ""stochastic discrimination"" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.
An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler,[10] who registered[11] ""Random Forests"" as a trademark in 2006 (as of 2019[update], owned by Minitab, Inc.).[12] The extension combines Breiman's ""bagging"" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman[13] in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.

In a random forest, each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample) from the training set. In addition, when splitting a node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the best split among a random subset of the features. As a result, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.

human_821,"In statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a model that the variance of the parameter estimated across samples can be reduced by increasing the bias in the estimated parameters.
The bias–variance dilemma or bias–variance problem is the conflict in trying to simultaneously minimize these two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from generalizing beyond their training set:
The bias–variance decomposition is a way of analyzing a learning algorithm's expected generalization error with respect to a particular problem as a sum of three terms, the bias, variance, and a quantity called the irreducible error, resulting from noise in the problem itself.",0
ai_822,"Bias–variance decomposition is a way of analyzing the performance of a machine learning model. It allows us to understand how much of the model's prediction error is due to bias, and how much is due to variance.



Bias is the difference between the predicted values of the model and the true values. A model with high bias tends to make the same prediction error consistently, regardless of the input data. This is because the model is oversimplified and does not capture the complexity of the problem.



Variance, on the other hand, is the variability of the model's predictions for a given input. A model with high variance tends to make large prediction errors for certain inputs, but smaller errors for others. This is because the model is overly sensitive to the specific characteristics of the training data, and may not generalize well to unseen data.



By understanding the bias and variance of a model, we can identify ways to improve its performance. For example, if a model has high bias, we might try increasing its complexity by adding more features or layers. If a model has high variance, we might try using techniques such as regularization or collecting more training data to reduce the sensitivity of the model.",1

The residual is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean).

For example, suppose we have a simple linear regression model that predicts the value of a response variable, Y, based on the value of a predictor variable, X. If we use the model to predict the value of Y for a given value of X, and the predicted value differs from the observed value of Y, the difference between the two is the error or residual.

human_825,"In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.
Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.: 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity.

There are several ways to express time complexity, but the most common is using ""big O"" notation. In big O notation, the time complexity of an algorithm is expressed as an upper bound on the number of steps the algorithm takes, as a function of the size of the input data.

An algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) takes at most a certain number of steps for each possible pair of elements in the input data.



It is important to note that time complexity is a measure of the worst-case performance of an algorithm. This means that the time complexity of an algorithm describes the maximum amount of time it could take to solve a problem, rather than the average or expected amount of time.



There are many factors that can affect the time complexity of an algorithm, including the type of operations it performs and the specific input data it is given. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and it is often important to choose the most efficient algorithm for a particular problem in order to save time and resources.",1
human_827,"In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.
For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i × 4).
The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.
Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called ""matrices"". In some cases the term ""vector"" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word ""table"" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.
Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.
Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.
The term ""array"" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.
The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or ""abstract array"", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.",0
ai_828,"An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items, typically in a contiguous block of memory. The items in an array are usually of the same data type, and are accessed using an index.



In many programming languages, an array is implemented as a fixed-size sequenced collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is assigned a unique index, which is used to identify and access the element. The first element in the array is assigned an index of 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1, and so on.



Here is an example of how you might declare and initialize an array of integers in C:



Copy code

int numbers[5];

numbers[0] = 10;

numbers[1] = 20;

numbers[2] = 30;

numbers[3] = 40;

numbers[4] = 50;

In this example, we have declared an array called numbers that can hold 5 integers. We have then initialized the array by assigning values to each element in the array. We can access the elements of the array using their indexes, like this:



Copy code

printf(""%d"", numbers[0]);  // prints 10

printf(""%d"", numbers[2]);  // prints 30

Arrays are a useful data structure for storing and manipulating large amounts of data, but they have some limitations. For example, the size of an array is fixed when it is created, so you cannot easily add or remove elements from the array. In addition, arrays are not well-suited for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the collection. For these types of operations, you might want to consider using a different data structure such as a linked list.",1

In general, similarity learning algorithms seek to learn a mapping from the input data space to a lower-dimensional space in which the distance between points reflects their similarity. This can be accomplished through a variety of techniques, such as linear or nonlinear dimensionality reduction, clustering, or metric learning.

human_831,"In statistics, probability density estimation or simply density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function.  The unobservable density function is thought of as the density according to which a large population is distributed; the data are usually thought of as a random sample from that population.
A variety of approaches to density estimation are used, including Parzen windows and a range of data clustering techniques, including vector quantization. The most basic form of density estimation is a rescaled histogram.",0
ai_832,"Density estimation is the process of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable. Given a set of observations, the goal of density estimation is to estimate the underlying distribution that generated the observations.



The probability density function (PDF) of a random variable is a function that describes the probability of observing different values of the random variable. It is used to specify the probability of an event occurring within a particular interval or range of values. The PDF is defined as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable.



There are various techniques for estimating the density of a random variable, including kernel density estimation, histogram-based methods, and parametric methods. Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the appropriate method to use depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.



In general, density estimation is an important tool in statistical analysis and machine learning, as it allows us to better understand the distribution of data and make more informed decisions based on that data. It is often used in applications such as data visualization, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.",1
human_833,"In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would be close to that sample. Probability density  is the  probability per unit length,  in other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.
In a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to 1.
The terms ""probability distribution function"" and ""probability function"" have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, ""probability distribution function"" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. ""Density function"" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion. In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.",0
ai_834,"A probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the probability of an event occurring within a certain range of values. It is a continuous function, meaning that it can take on any value within a certain range, as opposed to a discrete function, which can only take on specific, discrete values.



The probability density function is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It is defined such that the total area under the curve of the function is equal to 1, which represents the total probability of all possible outcomes. The probability of a specific range of values occurring is equal to the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.



For example, consider a continuous random variable X that has a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. The PDF of this random variable is given by the following equation:



f(x) = (1 / (σ * √(2π))) * e^-(((x - μ)^2) / (2σ^2))



This function describes the probability of X taking on any value within a certain range. The probability of X taking on a specific value is technically zero, since X is a continuous variable and can take on an infinite number of values within a certain range. However, the probability of X taking on a value within a certain range can be calculated by finding the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.



In general, the probability density function is a useful tool for understanding the probability distribution of a continuous random variable and for making statistical inferences about the variable.",1
human_835,"Weak supervision is a branch of machine learning where noisy, limited, or imprecise sources are used to provide supervision signal for labeling large amounts of training data in a supervised learning setting. This approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand-labeled data sets, which can be costly or impractical. Instead, inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect, but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model.",0
ai_836,"Weak supervision is a type of machine learning that involves using partial or noisy labels to train a model. In traditional machine learning, the model is typically trained on a dataset that has been carefully labeled by experts, with each example in the dataset having a clear and correct label. This is known as strong supervision.



In contrast, weak supervision involves using labels that are less accurate or less complete than those found in a strongly supervised dataset. For example, instead of manually labeling each example in the dataset, the labels might be generated automatically using heuristics or other methods that are not 100% accurate. As a result, the model being trained under weak supervision may not perform as well as a model trained under strong supervision, but it can still be useful in situations where it is difficult or impractical to obtain a large, high-quality labeled dataset.



Weak supervision is often used in natural language processing and other areas where it is difficult to obtain large amounts of labeled data. It can also be useful for improving the efficiency of the training process, as it allows a model to be trained using a smaller labeled dataset and supplemented with additional, weakly labeled data.",1
human_837,"In computer science, a software agent or software AI is a computer program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency, which derives from the Latin agere (to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such ""action on behalf of"" implies the authority to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Agents are colloquially known as bots, from robot. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or  as software such as a chatbot executing on a phone (e.g. Siri)  or other computing device.  Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people.  Software agents interacting with people (e.g. chatbots, human-robot interaction environments) may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality or embody humanoid form (see Asimo).
Related and derived concepts include intelligent agents (in particular exhibiting some aspects of artificial intelligence, such as reasoning), autonomous agents (capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives), distributed agents (being executed on physically distinct computers), multi-agent systems (distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone), and mobile agents (agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors).",0

human_839,"Action selection is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, ""the action selection problem"" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment. The term is also sometimes used in ethology or animal behavior.
One problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an ""act"". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from contracting a muscle cell to provoking a war. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.
Most researchers working in this field place high demands on their agents:

It can be a complex process, particularly when there are multiple conflicting or competing objectives, or when the consequences of different actions are uncertain or hard to predict.



In artificial intelligence, action selection is an important aspect of decision-making, and is often addressed through techniques such as planning, reinforcement learning, and decision trees.

human_841,"Control theory is a field of mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality.
To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  controllability and observability.  Control theory is used in control system engineering to design automation  that have revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, and created new fields such as robotics.  
Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram. In it the transfer function, also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system.
Control theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell.  Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874, Charles Sturm and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz, who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky.
Although a major application of mathematical control theory is in control systems engineering, which deals with the design of process control systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this. As the general theory of feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs - thus control theory also has applications in life sciences, computer engineering, sociology and operations research.",0

Control systems can be classified into two main categories: open-loop systems and closed-loop systems. In an open-loop system, there is no feedback between the system and its environment, so the system's output is determined solely by its inputs. In a closed-loop system, the output of the system is fed back to the system as an input, which allows the system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment.

human_845,"Simulation-based optimization (also known as simply simulation optimization) integrates optimization techniques into simulation modeling and analysis. Because of the complexity of the simulation, the objective function may become difficult and expensive to evaluate. Usually, the underlying simulation model is stochastic, so that the objective function must be estimated using statistical estimation techniques (called output analysis in simulation methodology).
Once a system is mathematically modeled, computer-based simulations provide information about its behavior. Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed. This is a time-consuming method and improves the performance partially. To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution. Such methods are known as ‘numerical optimization’ or ‘simulation-based optimization’.
In simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.
Specific simulation–based optimization methods can be chosen according to Figure 1 based on the decision variable types.
Optimization exists in two main branches of operations research:
Optimization parametric (static) – The objective is to find the values of the parameters, which are “static” for all states, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing a function. In this case, one can use mathematical programming, such as linear programming. In this scenario, simulation helps when the parameters contain noise or the evaluation of the problem would demand excessive computer time, due to its complexity.
Optimization control (dynamic) – This is used largely in computer science and electrical engineering. The optimal control is per state and the results change in each of them. One can use mathematical programming, as well as dynamic programming. In this scenario, simulation can generate random samples and solve complex and large-scale problems.",0
ai_846,"Simulation-based optimization is a method of solving optimization problems by using computer simulations to evaluate the performance of different candidate solutions. It is a useful technique when the objective function or the constraints of the optimization problem are difficult or impossible to express analytically, or when the problem involves complex systems or processes that cannot be easily modeled mathematically.



In simulation-based optimization, a computer model of the system or process under consideration is used to generate simulated outcomes for different candidate solutions. The optimization algorithm then uses these simulated outcomes to guide the search for the best solution. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows the optimization algorithm to consider a wide range of possible solutions, rather than being limited to those that can be expressed analytically.



Simulation-based optimization is commonly used in a variety of fields, including engineering, operations research, and economics. It can be applied to optimize a wide range of problems, including resource allocation, scheduling, logistics, and design problems.



There are several different algorithms and approaches that can be used for simulation-based optimization, including evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization.

human_847,"Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.
In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.
If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.",0
ai_848,"Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. It is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem. The key to using dynamic programming is to identify a recursive structure in the problem, as well as an ""optimal substructure"" that can be exploited to break the problem down into smaller pieces.



Dynamic programming algorithms are often used for optimization problems, where the goal is to find the optimal solution among a set of possible solutions. These algorithms typically involve solving the same subproblems multiple times, so it is important to store the solutions to these subproblems in a table or an array to avoid re-computing them. This technique is known as ""memoization"".



Dynamic programming algorithms are typically implemented using a bottom-up approach, in which the solutions to the smaller subproblems are computed first and used to build up the solution to larger subproblems. This is in contrast to the top-down approach used in recursive algorithms, which begins with the solution to the overall problem and breaks it down into smaller subproblems.



Examples of problems that can be solved using dynamic programming include:



Shortest path problems, such as finding the shortest path through a maze or the shortest path between two points on a map

Knapsack problems, where the goal is to maximize the value of items that can be carried in a knapsack of limited size

Sequence alignment problems, which are used in bioinformatics to identify similarities between DNA or protein sequences

Protein folding problems, which are used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence

Dynamic programming can be a useful technique for solving complex problems, but it can also be computationally intensive, as it involves solving the same subproblems multiple times. It is important to carefully consider whether dynamic programming is the most appropriate approach for a given problem.",1
human_849,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 unit vectors, where the 



i


{\displaystyle i}

-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first 



i

1


{\displaystyle i-1}

 vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.
In data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  



p


{\displaystyle p}

 variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  



p


{\displaystyle p}

 iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.
PCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The 



i


{\displaystyle i}

-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first

{\displaystyle i-1}

 principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.
For either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.",0
ai_850,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set. It does this by identifying the directions in which the data varies the most, and projecting the data onto a new set of axes that are aligned with these directions. The resulting axes, called ""principal components,"" are a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) dimensions that capture the maximum amount of variance in the data.



PCA is often used as a data preprocessing step to reduce the complexity of a data set, or to remove redundant or correlated features. It can also be used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, or to extract features that are relevant for a particular analysis.



PCA is based on the idea that the data can be represented as a linear combination of a few underlying patterns or ""components."" These components are derived from the data itself and are ranked in order of importance, with the first component capturing the most variance, the second component capturing the next most variance, and so on. The resulting principal components are orthogonal to each other, which means that they are uncorrelated and provide independent information about the data.



PCA is a useful tool for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and genomics, among others. It is particularly useful for data sets that have a large number of features, as it can help to identify the most important features and reduce the dimensionality of the data without losing too much information.",1
human_851,"Nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also known as manifold learning, refers to various related techniques that aim to project high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional latent manifolds, with the goal of either visualizing the data in the low-dimensional space, or learning the mapping (either from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional embedding or vice versa) itself. The techniques described below can be understood as generalizations of linear decomposition methods used for dimensionality reduction, such as singular value decomposition and principal component analysis.",0
ai_852,"Manifold learning is a technique used to analyze and visualize high-dimensional data by representing it in a lower-dimensional space. It is based on the idea that high-dimensional data is often ""manifold"" or ""folded"" in a lower-dimensional space, meaning that it can be represented more efficiently in a lower-dimensional space while still preserving the important patterns and structure of the data.



There are many different algorithms that can be used for manifold learning, including techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). These algorithms can be used to project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space, such as a two-dimensional plot, which can make it easier to visualize and understand the data.



Manifold learning is often used in applications such as data visualization, pattern recognition, and machine learning, where it can help to uncover the underlying structure of the data and identify patterns that may not be apparent in the high-dimensional space. It can also be useful for reducing the dimensionality of data, which can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms and make it easier to work with large datasets.",1
human_853,"In machine learning, Manifold regularization is a technique for using the shape of a dataset to constrain the functions that should be learned on that dataset. In many machine learning problems, the data to be learned do not cover the entire input space. For example, a facial recognition system may not need to classify any possible image, but only the subset of images that contain faces. The technique of manifold learning assumes that the relevant subset of data comes from a manifold, a mathematical structure with useful properties. The technique also assumes that the function to be learned is smooth: data with different labels are not likely to be close together, and so the labeling function should not change quickly in areas where there are likely to be many data points. Because of this assumption, a manifold regularization algorithm can use unlabeled data to inform where the learned function is allowed to change quickly and where it is not, using an extension of the technique of Tikhonov regularization. Manifold regularization algorithms can extend supervised learning algorithms in semi-supervised learning and transductive learning settings, where unlabeled data are available. The technique has been used for applications including medical imaging, geographical imaging, and object recognition.",0
ai_854,"Manifold regularization is a technique that is used to regularize machine learning models in order to improve their generalization performance. It is based on the idea that the data that the model is being trained on lies on a low-dimensional manifold, which is embedded in a higher-dimensional space.



The goal of manifold regularization is to enforce the model to respect this underlying structure of the data and to avoid fitting to noise or outliers. This can be achieved by adding a regularization term to the objective function of the model, which penalizes deviations from the manifold.



There are several ways to incorporate manifold regularization into a machine learning model. One common approach is to use a graph-based regularization term, which encourages the model to stay close to the data points that are connected by edges in the graph. Another approach is to use an autoencoder, which is trained to reconstruct the input data from a low-dimensional latent representation. The reconstruction loss can then be used as a regularization term to encourage the model to stay close to the manifold.



Manifold regularization has been shown to be effective in a variety of machine learning tasks, including classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It can be particularly useful in situations where the data is noisy or has a complex underlying structure that is difficult to model directly.",1
human_855,"In statistics and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract ""topics"" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: ""dog"" and ""bone"" will appear more often in documents about dogs, ""cat"" and ""meow"" will appear in documents about cats, and ""the"" and ""is"" will appear approximately equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. The ""topics"" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discovering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and what each document's balance of topics is.
Topic models are also referred to as probabilistic topic models, which refers to statistical algorithms for discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body. In the age of information, the amount of the written material we encounter each day is simply beyond our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies. Originally developed as a text-mining tool, topic models have been used to detect instructive structures in data such as genetic information, images, and networks. They also have applications in other fields such as bioinformatics and computer vision.",0
ai_856,"Topic modeling is a type of text mining technique that automatically extracts the main topics or themes from a large collection of documents. It involves identifying and extracting the main topics from a set of documents in an unsupervised manner, meaning that the algorithm is not given any prior information about the topics that the documents are expected to cover.



Topic modeling algorithms work by analyzing the words in the documents and identifying patterns and relationships between them to discover the underlying topics. These algorithms typically start by representing each document as a bag of words, which is a list of the words in the document with the order of the words removed. The algorithm then uses statistical techniques to identify the most common words and phrases that occur together and assigns them to the same topic.



Topic modeling is a useful tool for many different applications, such as information retrieval, text summarization, and text classification. It can help to identify the main themes in a large collection of documents, such as a set of news articles or research papers, and can be used to organize and categorize the documents in a way that is more easily understood and navigated.",1
human_857,"Meta learning
is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. As of 2017 the term had not found a standard interpretation, however the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.
Flexibility is important because each learning algorithm is based on a set of assumptions about the data, its inductive bias. This means that it will only learn well if the bias matches the learning problem. A learning algorithm may perform very well in one domain, but not on the next. This poses strong restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques, since the relationship between the learning problem (often some kind of database) and the effectiveness of different learning algorithms is not yet understood.
By using different kinds of metadata, like properties of the learning problem, algorithm properties (like performance measures), or patterns previously derived from the data, it is possible to learn, select, alter or combine different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given learning problem. Critiques of meta learning approaches bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic, a possibly related problem. A good analogy to meta-learning, and the inspiration for Jürgen Schmidhuber's early work (1987) and Yoshua Bengio et al.'s work (1991), considers that genetic evolution learns the learning procedure encoded in genes and executed in each individual's brain. In an open-ended hierarchical meta learning system using genetic programming, better evolutionary methods can be learned by meta evolution, which itself can be improved by meta meta evolution, etc.

ai_858,"Meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, refers to the ability of a machine learning model to adapt to new tasks or environments quickly, using knowledge and experience from previous tasks.



In the context of computer science, meta-learning involves training a model on a large number of tasks, such that it can learn to learn and adapt to new tasks more efficiently. This is typically done by training the model on a set of related tasks, and then fine-tuning it on a new task using only a few examples.



Meta-learning can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models in a variety of applications, including robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision. It has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of data and computation required to learn new tasks, making it a promising approach for building intelligent systems that can adapt and learn in real-world environments.",1
human_859,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 unit vectors, where the 



i


{\displaystyle i}

-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first 



i
−
1


{\displaystyle i-1}

 vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.
In data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  



p


{\displaystyle p}

 variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  



p


{\displaystyle p}

 iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.
PCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The 



i


{\displaystyle i}

-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first 



i
−
1


{\displaystyle i-1}

 principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.
For either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.",0
ai_860,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space. It is a widely used method in the field of machine learning, and it is often used to pre-process data before applying other machine learning algorithms.



In PCA, the goal is to find a new set of dimensions (called ""principal components"") that represent the data in a way that preserves as much of the variance in the data as possible. These new dimensions are orthogonal to each other, which means that they are not correlated. This can be useful because it can help to remove noise and redundancy from the data, which can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.



To perform PCA, the data is first standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Then, the covariance matrix of the data is calculated, and the eigenvectors of this matrix are found. The eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues are chosen as the principal components, and the data is projected onto these components to obtain the lower-dimensional representation of the data.



PCA is a powerful technique that can be used to visualize high-dimensional data, identify patterns in the data, and reduce the complexity of the data for further analysis. It is commonly used in a variety of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and genomics.",1
human_861,"A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a fully connected class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The term MLP is used ambiguously, sometimes loosely to mean any feedforward ANN, sometimes strictly to refer to networks composed of multiple layers of perceptrons (with threshold activation); see § Terminology. Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as ""vanilla"" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.
An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.",0
ai_862,"A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that is composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons, or ""perceptrons."" It is called a ""multilayer"" perceptron because it is composed of at least three layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.



The input layer receives the input data and passes it on to the hidden layer(s), which process the data using weighted connections between the neurons. The output layer produces the final output of the MLP, which can be used for various tasks such as classification or prediction.



MLPs are often used for supervised learning tasks, in which the goal is to learn a function that maps input data to output labels or values. They are particularly useful for tasks that require the modeling of complex relationships between the input data and the output labels.



MLPs are a simple and powerful tool for many machine learning tasks, but they can be limited by the fact that they do not have the ability to process inputs that are not provided in their input layer. This can make them less effective for tasks that require the processing of sequential or temporal data, such as natural language processing or speech recognition.",1
human_863,"Sparse coding is a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data (also known as sparse coding) in the form of a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves. These elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary. Atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal, and they may be an over-complete spanning set. This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.
One of the most important applications of sparse dictionary learning is in the field of compressed sensing or signal recovery. In compressed sensing, a high-dimensional signal can be recovered with only a few linear measurements provided that the signal is sparse or nearly sparse. Since not all signals satisfy this sparsity condition, it is of great importance to find a sparse representation of that signal such as the wavelet transform or the directional gradient of a rasterized matrix. Once a matrix or a high dimensional vector is transferred to a sparse space, different recovery algorithms like basis pursuit, CoSaMP or fast non-iterative algorithms can be used to recover the signal.
One of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as Fourier or wavelet transforms). However, in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity, which has applications in data decomposition, compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image denoising and classification, video and audio processing. Sparsity and overcomplete dictionaries have immense applications in image compression, image fusion and inpainting.",0
ai_864,"Dictionary learning is a machine learning technique used to represent a set of data points as a linear combination of a fixed set of ""atoms"" or basis elements. The goal of dictionary learning is to find a compact and efficient representation of the data, where each data point can be represented as a linear combination of a small number of atoms.



In dictionary learning, the atoms are typically chosen to be a set of representative basis elements that capture the structure and patterns in the data. The coefficients of the linear combination (also called the ""codes"") are then used to reconstruct the data points.



Dictionary learning can be used for various tasks, such as image and signal processing, natural language processing, and data compression. It has been widely used in many applications, including image denoising, image super-resolution, and image inpainting, to name a few.



Dictionary learning algorithms typically involve an optimization process to find the atoms and codes that best represent the data. There are various algorithms and approaches for dictionary learning, including methods based on matrix factorization, gradient descent, and alternating optimization.",1
human_865,"In signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents. This is done by assuming that at most one subcomponent is Gaussian and that the subcomponents are statistically independent from each other. ICA is a special case of blind source separation. A common example application is the ""cocktail party problem"" of listening in on one person's speech in a noisy room.",0
ai_866,"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical technique used to identify and separate independent sources of information that are mixed together in a dataset. It is used in a variety of fields, including signal processing, neuroscience, and machine learning, to extract meaningful information from complex data.



The basic idea behind ICA is to find a linear transformation of the mixed data that maximally separates the underlying sources. This is done by finding a set of so-called ""independent components"" that are as independent as possible from each other, while still being able to reconstruct the mixed data.



In practice, ICA is often used to separate a mixture of signals, such as audio signals or image data, into its component parts. For example, in audio signals, ICA can be used to separate the vocals from the music in a song, or to separate different instruments in a recording. In image data, ICA can be used to separate different objects or features in an image.



ICA is typically used in situations where the number of sources is known and the mixing process is linear, but the individual sources are unknown and are mixed together in a way that makes it difficult to separate them. ICA algorithms are designed to find the independent components of the mixed data, even if the sources are non-Gaussian and correlated.",1
ai_867,"Matrix decomposition is a method of expressing a matrix in a specific form. There are several types of matrix decompositions, each with its own specific purpose and application. Some of the most common types of matrix decompositions are:



Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, S, and V, where U and V are unitary matrices and S is a diagonal matrix. SVD is often used for dimensionality reduction and data compression.



Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD): EVD decomposes a matrix into two matrices: D and V, where D is a diagonal matrix and V is a unitary matrix. EVD is often used to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, which can be used to analyze the behavior of linear systems.



QR Decomposition: QR decomposition decomposes a matrix into two matrices: Q and R, where Q is a unitary matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix. QR decomposition is often used to solve systems of linear equations and compute the least squares solution to a linear system.



Cholesky Decomposition: Cholesky decomposition decomposes a matrix into two matrices: L and L^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose. Cholesky decomposition is often used to solve systems of linear equations and to compute the determinant of a matrix.



Matrix decomposition can be a useful tool in many areas of science, engineering, and data analysis, as it allows matrices to be manipulated and analyzed more easily.",1
human_868,"Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.
Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.
Besides the term clustering, there is a number of terms with similar meanings, including automatic classification, numerical taxonomy, botryology (from Greek βότρυς ""grape""), typological analysis, and community detection. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.
Cluster analysis was originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Joseph Zubin in 1938 and Robert Tryon in 1939 and famously used by Cattell beginning in 1943 for trait theory classification in personality psychology.",0
ai_869,"Cluster analysis is a method of data analysis that divides a set of data points into groups, or clusters, based on their similarity. The goal of cluster analysis is to group data points in such a way that data points within a group are more similar to each other than they are to data points in other groups.



There are many different methods of cluster analysis, and the appropriate method to use depends on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis. Some common methods of cluster analysis include hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and density-based clustering.



Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that creates a hierarchy of clusters, with each cluster nested within another cluster. This method begins by treating each data point as a single cluster, and then repeatedly merges the two most similar clusters until a hierarchy of clusters is formed.



K-means clustering is a method of cluster analysis that divides a set of data points into k clusters, where k is specified by the user. The algorithm works by randomly selecting k initial centroids, and then assigning each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid. The centroids are then recalculated based on the data points in the cluster, and the process is repeated until the clusters stabilize.



Density-based clustering is a method of cluster analysis that groups data points into clusters based on their density. This method works by identifying areas of high density and treating them as clusters. Data points that are less dense are considered to be noise or outliers.



Cluster analysis is often used as a way to explore and understand patterns in data, and it can be useful for a wide range of applications, including market segmentation, image analysis, and gene expression analysis.",1

The goal is to find a set of basis functions that can represent the data with as few coefficients as possible, while still preserving the important features of the data.

The mapping from a high-dimensional vector space to a set of lower dimensional vector spaces is a multilinear projection. When observations are retained in the same organizational structure as matrices or higher order tensors, their representations are computed by performing linear projections into the column space, row space and fiber space.

One common approach to MSL is to use tensor decomposition techniques, such as the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) or the Tucker decomposition, to decompose the data tensor into a combination of low-dimensional subspace components. These subspace components can then be used to reconstruct the original data tensor, while retaining much of its structure and information.



Other techniques for MSL include multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) and multilinear independent component analysis (MICA), which are extensions of traditional linear techniques for dimensionality reduction and data analysis. These methods aim to find a set of low-dimensional subspaces that can capture the structure of the data in a multilinear manner.

Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio.
All signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device's mechanism or signal processing algorithms.
In electronic systems, a major type of noise is hiss created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise.
In the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger-sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise. To compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.",0

There are several different types of LCSs, including genetic algorithms, neural networks, and rule-based systems. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best type of LCS to use will depend on the specific problem being solved.",1
ai_884,"An artificial immune system is a type of computer system that is designed to mimic the functions of the human immune system. The human immune system is responsible for protecting the body against infection and disease by identifying and eliminating foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. An artificial immune system is designed to perform similar functions, such as detecting and responding to threats in a computer system, network, or other type of artificial environment.



Artificial immune systems use algorithms and machine learning techniques to recognize patterns and anomalies in data that may indicate the presence of a threat or vulnerability. They can be used to detect and respond to a wide range of threats, including viruses, malware, and cyber attacks.



One of the main advantages of artificial immune systems is that they can operate continuously, monitoring the system for threats and responding to them in real-time. This allows them to provide ongoing protection against threats, even when the system is not actively being used.



There are many different approaches to designing and implementing artificial immune systems, and they can be used in a variety of different settings, including in cybersecurity, medical diagnosis, and other areas where detecting and responding to threats is important.",1

human_886,"Affinity analysis falls under the umbrella term of data mining which uncovers meaningful correlations between different entities according to their co-occurrence in a data set. In almost all systems and processes, the application of affinity analysis can extract significant knowledge about the unexpected trends. In fact, affinity analysis takes advantages of studying attributes that go together which helps uncover the hidden pattens in a big data through generating association rules. Association rules mining procedure is two-fold: first, it finds all frequent attributes in a data set and, then generates association rules satisfying some predefined criteria, support and confidence, to identify the most important relationships in the frequent itemset. The first step in the process is to count the co-occurrence of attributes in the data set. Next, a subset is created called the frequent itemset. The association rules mining takes the form of if a condition or feature (A) is present then another condition or feature (B) exists. The first condition or feature (A) is called antecedent and the latter (B) is known as consequent. This process is repeated until no additional frequent itemsets are found.  There are two important metrics for performing the association rules mining technique: support and confidence. Also, a priori algorithm is used to reduce the search space for the problem.
The support metric in the association rule learning algorithm is defined as the frequency of the antecedent or consequent appearing together in a data set. Moreover, confidence is expressed as the reliability of the association rules determined by the ratio of the data records containing both A and B. The minimum threshold for support and confidence are inputs to the model. Considering all the above-mentioned definitions, affinity analysis can develop rules that will predict the occurrence of an event based on the occurrence of other events. This data mining method has been explored in different fields including disease diagnosis, market basket analysis, retail industry, higher education, and financial analysis. In retail, affinity analysis is used to perform market basket analysis, in which retailers seek to understand the purchase behavior of customers. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling, in addition to influencing sales promotions, loyalty programs, store design, and discount plans.",0
ai_887,"Market basket analysis is a data mining technique that is used to identify relationships between different items that are frequently purchased together. It is typically used in retail to identify items that are commonly purchased together, so that retailers can group these items together in the store or advertise them together to encourage more sales.



For example, if a retailer notices that customers who purchase bread are also likely to purchase butter and jam, they might place these items together in the store or advertise them together in a sale. By understanding these patterns in customer purchasing behavior, retailers can improve their marketing efforts and increase sales.



Market basket analysis is often used in conjunction with other data mining techniques, such as association rule mining, to identify patterns in large datasets and make informed decisions about marketing and sales strategies.",1
human_888,"Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.
The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.
The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]
The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.",0

There are several different approaches to web usage mining, including:



Preprocessing: This involves cleaning and preparing the web log data for analysis.

human_890,"An intrusion detection system (IDS; also intrusion prevention system or IPS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.
IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach. The most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of ""good"" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is reputation-based detection (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system. Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools, such as using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic.",0
ai_891,"Intrusion detection is the process of identifying and responding to attempts to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network. It involves continuously monitoring a system for signs of security breaches or threats, such as attempts to login with unauthorized credentials, unusual network traffic, or modifications to system files. When an intrusion is detected, the system can alert security personnel or take automated actions to prevent or mitigate the attack.



Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are designed to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. There are several types of IDS, including network-based IDS, host-based IDS, and wireless IDS. Network-based IDS monitors network traffic for signs of intrusion, while host-based IDS monitors activity on a single host or device. Wireless IDS monitors wireless network traffic for security threats.



Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are similar to IDS, but they are designed to actively block or mitigate intrusions. They can take a variety of actions in response to a detected intrusion, such as blocking traffic from a particular source, quarantining a device, or shutting down a service.



Intrusion detection and prevention are important components of a comprehensive security strategy, as they help organizations protect their systems and data from unauthorized access or attacks.",1
human_892,"Continuous production is a flow production method used to manufacture, produce, or process materials without interruption.  Continuous production is called a continuous process or a continuous flow process because the materials, either dry bulk or fluids that are being processed are continuously in motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment.  Continuous processing is contrasted with batch production.
Continuous usually means operating 24 hours per day, seven days per week with infrequent maintenance shutdowns, such as semi-annual or annual.  Some chemical plants can operate for more than one to two years without a shutdown.  Blast furnaces can run from four to ten years without stopping.",0
ai_893,"Continuous production is a manufacturing process in which products are produced in a continuous and uninterrupted flow. This means that the production process is not stopped or interrupted at any point during the production cycle. Instead, raw materials are continuously fed into the production process, and finished products are continuously produced and sent for further processing or packaging.



One of the main advantages of continuous production is that it allows for a high level of efficiency and productivity. Since the production process is not stopped or interrupted, there are fewer delays and less time is wasted. Continuous production also allows for the production of large quantities of products in a short amount of time, which can be beneficial in industries where there is a high demand for products.



There are several types of continuous production processes, including assembly lines, rolling mills, and extrusion processes. In an assembly line, raw materials are fed into the production process at one end, and finished products are produced at the other end. In a rolling mill, raw materials are fed into a machine that rolls them into a desired shape or size. In an extrusion process, raw materials are fed into a machine that shapes them into a desired shape using pressure and heat.

There are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field.  These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns, comparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members.  In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms  and itemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models  extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency constructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct.",0

human_896,"Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:
and are read declaratively as logical implications:
H is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:
In the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.
In ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:
Consider the following clause as an example:
based on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:
can be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by ""assigning"" socrates to X.
The declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.",0
ai_897,"Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm that is based on formal logic. It is a declarative programming paradigm, meaning that the programmer specifies what the program should do, rather than how it should be done.



In logic programming, programs are written in a logical language, such as Prolog. The programmer writes a set of logical statements, called ""clauses,"" that describe the relationships and constraints between different entities. These clauses are then used to make logical deductions and solve problems.



One of the main features of logic programming is that it allows for reasoning about uncertain or incomplete information. For example, a logic program might be able to deduce the answer to a question even if it does not have all of the necessary information. This makes it a useful tool for tasks that involve making inferences or solving problems where the information is uncertain or incomplete.



Logic programming is often used in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, as well as in other areas where the ability to reason about uncertain or incomplete information is important.

Inductive functional programming, which uses functional programming languages such as Lisp or Haskell, and most especially inductive logic programming, which uses logic programming languages such as Prolog and other logical representations  such as description logics, have been more prominent, but other (programming) language paradigms have also been used, such as constraint programming or probabilistic programming.",0

human_900,"In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.
In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.
Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.
Functional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on functions. Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang,[10][11][12] Elixir,[13] OCaml,[14][15] Haskell,[16][17] and F#.[18][19] Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like JavaScript in the Web,[20] R in statistics,[21][22] J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML.[23][24] Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values.[25] In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++11, C#,[26] Kotlin,[27] Perl,[28] PHP,[29] Python,[30] Go,[31] Rust,[32] Raku,[33] Scala,[34] and Java (since Java 8).[35]",0
ai_901,"Functional programming is a programming paradigm, or a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It is based on the idea of immutability, or the concept that once a piece of data is created, it cannot be changed.



In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. Functions in functional programming do not have side effects, meaning that they do not modify the state of the program or produce any observable interactions with the outside world, such as printing to the console or modifying a file on the filesystem.



Functional programming languages often use recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves, to perform complex computations. They also typically use higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.



Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s by mathematician Alonzo Church to study the concept of functions. It has been influential in the design of many programming languages, including Lisp, ML, and Haskell.

human_908,"Mathematical induction is a method for proving that a statement P(n) is true for every natural number n, that is, that the infinitely many cases P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), ...  all hold. Informal metaphors help to explain this technique, such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:
A proof by induction consists of two cases. The first, the base case, proves the statement for n = 0 without assuming any knowledge of other cases. The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case n = k, then it must also hold for the next case n = k + 1. These two steps establish that the statement holds for every natural number n. The base case does not necessarily begin with n = 0, but often with n = 1, and possibly with any fixed natural number n = N, establishing the truth of the statement for all natural numbers n ≥ N.
The method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees; this generalization, known as structural induction, is used in mathematical logic and computer science. Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, and is the foundation of most correctness proofs for computer programs.
Although its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be confused with inductive reasoning as used in philosophy (see Problem of induction). The mathematical method examines infinitely many cases to prove a general statement, but does so by a finite chain of deductive reasoning involving the variable n, which can take infinitely many values.",0
ai_909,"Mathematical induction is a method of proof that is used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (positive integers). It is based on the idea that if a statement is true for the base case (usually 0 or 1), and if the statement is true for one natural number, then it must be true for the next natural number. This process is then repeated until the statement has been proven for all natural numbers.



To prove a statement using mathematical induction, you must first prove that the statement is true for the base case. For example, if you want to prove that the statement ""for all natural numbers n, the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to n(n+1)/2"" is true, you would need to prove that it is true for the base case n = 0. In this case, the sum of the first 0 natural numbers is 0, and 0(0+1)/2 = 0, so the statement is true for the base case.



Once you have proved that the statement is true for the base case, you must then assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number, say k. Using this assumption, you must then prove that the statement must be true for the next natural number, k+1. For example, if you are trying to prove the statement above, you would assume that the sum of the first k natural numbers is equal to k(k+1)/2, and then use this assumption to prove that the sum of the first k+1 natural numbers is equal to (k+1)(k+2)/2.



If you can successfully prove the statement for the base case and for the next natural number, then you can use mathematical induction to conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers. This is because the base case and the next natural number are both true, and if the statement is true for one natural number, it must also be true for the next natural number, and so on. Therefore, by repeating this process indefinitely, you can prove that the statement is true for all natural numbers.",1

human_912,"In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a distance, duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations.[a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.[b]
The real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.[c]
The set of real numbers is denoted R or 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

 and is sometimes called ""the reals"".
The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of −1), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.
The real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).
Real numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.
Conversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.
The informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.",0
ai_913,"In mathematics, a real number is a value that represents a quantity along a continuous line. The real numbers include all the numbers that can be represented on the number line, including both rational and irrational numbers.



Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, such as 3/4 or 5/2. These numbers can be written as a simple fraction or as a decimal that either terminates (such as 1/4 = 0.25) or repeats (such as 1/3 = 0.333...).



Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple ratio of two integers. They can be written as an infinite decimal that does not repeat and does not terminate, such as the number pi (π), which is approximately equal to 3.14159.

human_914,"The process of weighting involves emphasizing the contribution of particular aspects of a phenomenon (or of a set of data) over others to an outcome or result; thereby highlighting those aspects in comparison to others in the analysis. That is, rather than each variable in the data set contributing equally to the final result, some of the data is adjusted to make a greater contribution than others. This is analogous to the practice of adding (extra) weight to one side of a pair of scales in order to favour either the buyer or seller.
While weighting may be applied to a set of data, such as epidemiological data, it is more commonly applied to measurements of light, heat, sound, gamma radiation, and in fact any stimulus that is spread over a spectrum of frequencies.",0
ai_915,"In mathematics, the term ""weight"" can have a few different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Here are a few examples:



In the context of a vector space, the weight of a vector is a measure of the importance or influence of that vector. For example, in a vector space of documents, the weight of a particular document vector might be determined by how frequently the words in that document appear in the collection of documents as a whole.



In the context of a graph, the weight of an edge is a numerical value that represents the strength or cost of the connection between two vertices. For example, in a graph of roadways, the weight of an edge might represent the distance or time required to travel between two cities.



In the context of a function, the weight of a term is a coefficient that multiplies that term. For example, in the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1, the weights of the terms 3x^2, 2x, and 1 are 3, 2, and 1, respectively.



In the context of a statistical model, the weight of an input variable is a coefficient that represents the strength of the relationship between that variable and the output variable. For example, in a linear regression model, the weights of the input variables are the coefficients that multiply those variables in the model equation.",1
human_916,"Medical diagnosis (abbreviated Dx, Dx, or Ds) is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs. It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis.
Diagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific. For example, redness of the skin (erythema), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis, in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom (or a group of several) that is pathognomonic.
Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor's visit. From the point of view of statistics, the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests.",0
ai_917,"Medical diagnosis is the process of determining the cause of a patient's symptoms and signs. It is usually done by a healthcare professional, such as a doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant, who performs a physical examination, asks about the patient's medical history, and may order various diagnostic tests. The purpose of medical diagnosis is to identify the specific condition or disease that is causing the patient's symptoms, so that appropriate treatment can be provided.



The process of medical diagnosis typically involves several steps:



Gathering information: This includes taking a thorough medical history, performing a physical examination, and reviewing any relevant medical records or test results.



Identifying the problem: Based on the information gathered, the healthcare professional will consider possible diagnoses and narrow down the list to the most likely ones.



Confirming the diagnosis: Additional tests may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. These may include laboratory tests, imaging studies (such as X-rays or CT scans), or other diagnostic procedures.



Providing treatment: Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the healthcare professional will recommend a treatment plan based on the specific condition or disease that has been diagnosed.



It is important to note that medical diagnosis is not always straightforward, and it may involve multiple steps and involve input from several healthcare professionals. In some cases, the diagnosis may not be immediately apparent, and further testing or follow-up may be necessary.",1
human_918,"Predictive modelling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.
In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of detection theory to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an email determining how likely that it is spam.
Models can use one or more classifiers in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set. For example, a model might be used to determine whether an email is spam or ""ham"" (non-spam).
Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of machine learning, as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as predictive analytics.
Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis.  In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest. In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships. This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that ""correlation does not imply causation"".",0

It is a common technique in data science and machine learning, and it involves using statistical and machine learning algorithms to build models that can make predictions based on a set of input features.



There are many different techniques used in predictive modeling, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The choice of technique will depend on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the data.



In order to build a predictive model, it is important to have a good understanding of the problem being addressed and the relevant data. This may involve exploring the data to understand its structure and relationships, selecting relevant features, and preprocessing the data to ensure that it is in a suitable form for modeling. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. It is also common to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure that it is making accurate predictions.",1
human_920,"In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or ""loops"" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes in a single straight line.
Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of children for each parent to exactly two. When the order of the children is specified, this data structure corresponds to an  ordered tree in graph theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children.
The abstract data type can be represented in a number of ways, including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list). Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes or ancestor lists for performance.
Trees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and trees in descriptive set theory.",0
ai_921,"In a tree data structure, a leaf node is a node that does not have any children. Leaf nodes are also sometimes referred to as terminal nodes.



A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node in a tree is called the root node, and the nodes below the root node are called child nodes. A node can have one or more child nodes, which are called its children. If a node has no children, it is called a leaf node. Leaf nodes are the endpoints of the tree, and they do not have any further branches.



For example, in a tree representing a file system, the leaf nodes might represent files, while the non-leaf nodes represent folders. In a decision tree, leaf nodes might represent the final decision or classification based on the values of the features or attributes.



Leaf nodes are important in tree data structures because they represent the endpoints of the tree. They are used to store data, and they are often used to make decisions or perform actions based on the data stored in the leaf nodes.",1

Rational decision making: This approach involves evaluating the pros and cons of each option and choosing the one that is most logical or reasonable based on the available information.



Intuitive decision making: This approach relies on gut instincts and past experiences to guide decision making.



Group decision making: This approach involves making decisions as a group, often through a process of discussion and consensus building.

human_926,"In machine learning, a probabilistic classifier is a classifier that is able to predict, given an observation of an input, a probability distribution over a set of classes, rather than only outputting the most likely class that the observation should belong to. Probabilistic classifiers provide classification that can be useful in its own right or when combining classifiers into ensembles.",0
ai_927,"Probabilistic classification is a type of machine learning algorithm that estimates the probability of a given input belonging to each possible class. It then assigns the input to the class with the highest probability.



In probabilistic classification, the model estimates the probability of an input belonging to each class using probability distributions. For example, if we have a binary classification problem with two classes, ""positive"" and ""negative,"" the model might estimate the probability of an input belonging to the ""positive"" class using a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of an input belonging to the ""negative"" class using a complementary Bernoulli distribution.



Probabilistic classification can be contrasted with non-probabilistic classification, which simply assigns an input to the class with the highest predicted probability without considering the actual probability values.



One advantage of probabilistic classification is that it can provide a more nuanced and calibrated prediction, as it considers the actual probability of an input belonging to each class. This can be useful in applications where it is important to have a sense of the uncertainty of the prediction, such as in medical diagnosis or financial risk assessment.",1
human_928,"Binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into two groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical binary classification problems include:
Binary classification is dichotomization applied to a practical situation. In many practical binary classification problems, the two groups are not symmetric, and rather than overall accuracy, the relative proportion of different types of errors is of interest. For example, in medical testing, detecting a disease when it is not present (a false positive) is considered differently from not detecting a disease when it is present (a false negative).",0

Binary classifiers are used in a variety of applications, including spam detection, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.



Binary classifiers use input data to make predictions about the probability that a given example belongs to one of the two classes. For example, a binary classifier might be used to predict whether an email is spam or not spam based on the words and phrases it contains. The classifier might assign a probability that the email is spam, and then make a prediction based on whether that probability is above or below a certain threshold.

human_930,"In the field of machine learning, the goal of statistical classification is to use an object's characteristics to identify which class (or group) it belongs to.  A linear classifier achieves this by making a classification decision based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics.  An object's characteristics are also known as feature values and are typically presented to the machine in a vector called a feature vector. Such classifiers work well for practical problems such as document classification, and more generally for problems with many variables (features), reaching accuracy levels comparable to non-linear classifiers while taking less time to train and use.",0
ai_931,"A linear classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify data points into one of two or more classes. It works by finding the linear decision boundary that separates the classes in the feature space. The decision boundary is a line or plane that separates the data points into different regions, with each region corresponding to a different class.



Linear classifiers are based on the assumption that the data is linearly separable, meaning that there is a straight line or plane that can be drawn to separate the different classes. This means that the decision boundary is a linear function of the input features. Some examples of linear classifiers include logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines (SVMs).



Linear classifiers are fast and easy to implement, and they work well on a wide range of problems. They are particularly useful when the data is high-dimensional and there are a large number of features, as they are able to handle this type of data efficiently. However, they may not be as effective on more complex datasets where the decision boundary is non-linear. In these cases, it may be necessary to use more powerful, non-linear classifiers such as neural networks.",1
human_932,"In machine learning, Platt scaling or Platt calibration is a way of transforming the outputs of a classification model into a probability distribution over classes. The method was invented by John Platt in the context of support vector machines,

Platt scaling works by fitting a logistic regression model to a classifier's scores.",0
ai_933,"Platt scaling, also known as Platt's probability calibration, is a method used to improve the predictive probability of a binary classifier. It is often used when the predicted probabilities of a classifier are poorly calibrated, meaning that the predicted probabilities do not accurately reflect the true probabilities of the predicted classes.



To apply Platt scaling, you need to have a set of predicted probabilities for a binary classification task and the corresponding true labels. You can then fit a sigmoid curve to these predicted probabilities using a maximum likelihood optimization procedure. The sigmoid curve maps the predicted probabilities to a new scale that is better calibrated with the true probabilities.



For example, suppose you have a classifier that predicts the probability of an email being spam. Without Platt scaling, the classifier might output probabilities that are too high or too low, leading to poor performance in terms of precision and recall. By applying Platt scaling, you can adjust the predicted probabilities to be more accurately calibrated with the true labels, resulting in improved performance on the classification task.



Platt scaling is a simple and effective way to improve the predictive probability of a binary classifier, and it is widely used in various applications, such as spam filtering and credit risk assessment.",1
human_934,"In machine learning, kernel machines are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support-vector machine (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over all pairs of data points computed using Inner products. The feature map in kernel machines is infinite dimensional but only requires a finite dimensional matrix from user-input according to the Representer theorem. Kernel machines are slow to compute for datasets larger than a couple of thousand examples without parallel processing. 
Kernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.  This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates.  This approach is called the ""kernel trick"". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors.
Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support-vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others.
Most kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded. Typically, their statistical properties are analyzed using statistical learning theory (for example, using Rademacher complexity).",0
ai_935,"The kernel trick is a technique used in machine learning to enable the use of non-linear models in algorithms that are designed to work with linear models. It does this by applying a transformation to the data, which maps it into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable.



One of the main benefits of the kernel trick is that it allows us to use linear algorithms to perform non-linear classification or regression tasks. This is possible because the kernel function acts as a similarity measure between data points, and allows us to compare points in the original feature space using the inner product of their transformed representations in the higher-dimensional space.



The kernel trick is commonly used in support vector machines (SVMs) and other types of kernel-based learning algorithms. It allows these algorithms to make use of non-linear decision boundaries, which can be more effective at separating different classes of data in some cases.



For example, consider a dataset that contains two classes of data points that are not linearly separable in the original feature space. If we apply a kernel function to the data that maps it into a higher-dimensional space, the resulting points may be linearly separable in this new space. This means that we can use a linear classifier, such as an SVM, to separate the points and classify them correctly.",1
human_936,"In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.
In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.
Linear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications. This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.
Linear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:
Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the ""lack of fit"" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms ""least squares"" and ""linear model"" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.",0
ai_937,"Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a widely used technique for predicting a continuous outcome.



In linear regression, the relationship between the dependent variable (which is the variable we are trying to predict) and the independent variable(s) (which are the factors that might influence the dependent variable) is modeled using a linear equation. The equation has the form:



y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn



where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the regression coefficients. The coefficients represent the relationships between the dependent and independent variables.



For example, if we wanted to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet), we could use linear regression to model the relationship between the size of a house (the independent variable) and its price (the dependent variable). The model would be trained on data where the size of the house and its price are known, and then we can use the model to predict the price of a house given its size.



Linear regression is a simple and widely used technique, but it has some limitations. It assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear, which may not always be the case. In addition, it assumes that the relationship between the variables is additive, meaning that the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is constant regardless of the values of the other independent variables.",1
human_938,"In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) is a type of linear least squares method for choosing the unknown parameters in a linear regression model (with fixed level-one effects of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables) by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the input dataset and the output of the (linear) function of the independent variable.
Geometrically, this is seen as the sum of the squared distances, parallel to the axis of the dependent variable, between each data point in the set and the corresponding point on the regression surface—the smaller the differences, the better the model fits the data. The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula, especially in the case of a simple linear regression, in which there is a single regressor on the right side of the regression equation.
The OLS estimator is consistent for the level-one fixed effects when the regressors are exogenous and forms perfect colinearity (rank condition), consistent for the variance estimate of the residuals when regressors have finite fourth moments  and—by the Gauss–Markov theorem—optimal in the class of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and serially uncorrelated. Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite variances. Under the additional assumption that the errors are normally distributed with zero mean, OLS is the maximum likelihood estimator that outperforms any non-linear unbiased estimator.",0
ai_939,"Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. Linear regression is a statistical model that describes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

This is done by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable. The difference between the predicted value and the actual value is called the residual.



To find the best fit, OLS uses an optimization algorithm to find the values of the parameters that minimize the sum of the squared residuals. The resulting model is called the OLS model.



OLS is widely used in statistical modeling and data analysis because it is relatively simple to implement and has nice statistical properties. It is also easy to interpret, as the parameters of the model can be directly related to the relationships between the variables in the model.",1
human_940,"Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems.[a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).
The theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.
Ridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.",0
ai_941,"Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that aims to address the problem of multicollinearity, which occurs when predictors in a regression model are correlated. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and inconsistent coefficient estimates, which can make it difficult to interpret the results of a regression model. Ridge regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the regression objective function that shrinks the coefficients of the predictors towards zero. This shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, which can help to stabilize the model and improve its interpretability.



Ridge regression is implemented by adding a penalty term to the least squares objective function, which is the objective function that is minimized in linear regression. The penalty term is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. The objective function for ridge regression is given by:



$J(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2$



Where $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients, $y_i$ is the response variable, $x_{ij}$ is the predictor variable, and $\lambda$ is the penalty hyperparameter. The first term is the least squares objective function, and the second term is the penalty term.



Ridge regression has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, and it can provide good performance even when there is multicollinearity in the data. However, it is important to tune the penalty hyperparameter to ensure that the model is not over- or under-regularized. Over-regularization can lead to a model that is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data, while under-regularization can result in a model that is too complex and overfits the data.",1
human_942,"In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data.  For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.
The explanatory (independent) variables resulting from the polynomial expansion of the ""baseline"" variables are known as higher-degree terms. Such variables are also used in classification settings.",0
ai_943,"Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression can be used to model relationships between variables that are not linear.



A polynomial regression model is a special case of a multiple linear regression model, in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. The general form of a polynomial regression model is given by:



y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + ... + bn*x^n



where b0, b1, ..., bn are the coefficients of the polynomial, and x is the independent variable. The degree of the polynomial (i.e., the value of n) determines the flexibility of the model. A higher degree polynomial can capture more complex relationships between x and y, but it can also lead to overfitting if the model is not well-tuned.



To fit a polynomial regression model, you need to choose the degree of the polynomial and estimate the coefficients of the polynomial. This can be done using standard linear regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or gradient descent.



Polynomial regression is useful for modeling relationships between variables that are not linear. It can be used to fit a curve to a set of data points and make predictions about future values of the dependent variable based on new values of the independent variable.

It is particularly useful for analyzing time series data, and can be used to make predictions about future values of the target variable based on past observations.",1
ai_946,"A graphical model is a probabilistic model for representing the relationships between variables in a graph. Each variable is represented as a node in the graph, and the edges between the nodes represent the relationships between the variables. The graph encodes a set of conditional independencies between the variables, which means that the probability distribution of the variables can be represented compactly by only specifying the values of the variables that are directly connected by edges in the graph.



Graphical models are used to represent and reason about complex systems in which the relationships between the variables are uncertain or hard to quantify. They are a useful tool for modeling and analyzing data, particularly in the fields of machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence.



There are two main types of graphical models: directed graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks, and undirected graphical models, also known as Markov random fields. In a directed graphical model, the edges in the graph represent a causal relationship between the variables, while in an undirected graphical model, the edges represent a statistical relationship between the variables.



Graphical models provide a powerful framework for representing and reasoning about complex systems, and have been applied to a wide range of problems, including speech recognition, image classification, natural language processing, and many others.",1

Informally, randomness typically represents some fundamental element of chance, such as in the roll of a dice; it may also represent uncertainty, such as measurement error. However, the interpretation of probability is philosophically complicated, and even in specific cases is not always straightforward. The purely mathematical analysis of random variables is independent of such interpretational difficulties, and can be based upon a rigorous axiomatic setup.
In the formal mathematical language of measure theory, a random variable is defined as a measurable function from a probability measure space (called the sample space) to a measurable space. This allows consideration of the pushforward measure, which is called the distribution of the random variable; the distribution is thus a probability measure on the set of all possible values of the random variable. It is possible for two random variables to have identical distributions but to differ in significant ways; for instance, they may be independent.
It is common to consider the special cases of discrete random variables and absolutely continuous random variables, corresponding to whether a random variable is valued in a discrete set (such as a finite set) or in an interval of real numbers. There are other important possibilities, especially in the theory of stochastic processes, wherein it is natural to consider random sequences or random functions. Sometimes a random variable is taken to be automatically valued in the real numbers, with more general random quantities instead being called random elements.
According to George Mackey, Pafnuty Chebyshev was the first person ""to think systematically in terms of random variables"".",0
ai_948,"A random variable is a variable that can take on different values randomly. It is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment. For example, consider the random experiment of rolling a single die. The possible outcomes of this experiment are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We can define a random variable X to represent the outcome of rolling a die, such that X = 1 if the outcome is 1, X = 2 if the outcome is 2, and so on.



There are two types of random variables: discrete and continuous. A discrete random variable is one that can take on only a finite or countably infinite number of values, such as the number of heads that appear when flipping a coin three times. A continuous random variable is one that can take on any value within a certain range, such as the time it takes for a person to run a mile.



Probability distributions are used to describe the possible values that a random variable can take on and the likelihood of each value occurring. For example, the probability distribution for the random variable X described above (the outcome of rolling a die) would be a uniform distribution, since each outcome is equally likely.",1

The concept of conditional independence is essential to graph-based theories of statistical inference, as it establishes a mathematical relation between a collection of conditional statements and a graphoid.",0
ai_950,"Conditional independence is a statistical concept that refers to the absence of a relationship between two variables, given the value of a third variable. In other words, if we know the value of the third variable, the presence or absence of a relationship between the other two variables does not change.



For example, consider a study on the relationship between income and education level. The relationship between these two variables might be strong - that is, people with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. However, if we introduce a third variable, such as race, into the analysis, the relationship between income and education level might become weaker or disappear altogether. This is because race could be a confounding variable that influences both income and education level. In this case, we would say that income and education level are conditionally independent given race.



Conditional independence can be useful for statistical modeling and data analysis, as it allows us to identify and control for confounding variables that might influence the relationships between other variables. It can also be used to simplify statistical models by eliminating unnecessary variables and assumptions.",1
human_951,"In mathematics, particularly graph theory, and computer science, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions. DAGs have numerous scientific and computational applications, ranging from biology (evolution, family trees, epidemiology) to information science (citation networks) to computation (scheduling).
Directed acyclic graphs are sometimes instead called acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.",0
ai_952,"A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a type of directed graph that has no cycles. In other words, it is a graph where it is impossible to start at any vertex and follow a sequence of edges that eventually loops back to the starting vertex.



DAGs have a number of interesting properties and are used in a variety of contexts, including:



Modeling dependencies: DAGs can be used to represent the dependencies between different tasks or pieces of data. For example, in a build system, the edges in the DAG might represent the dependencies between different source files, and a node in the DAG might represent the compilation of a particular source file.



Data processing: DAGs can be used to represent the steps in a data processing pipeline. For example, in a machine learning system, the nodes in the DAG might represent different preprocessing or feature engineering steps, and the edges in the DAG might represent the flow of data between these steps.



Scheduling: DAGs can be used to represent the relationships between different jobs or tasks that need to be scheduled. For example, in a job scheduling system, the nodes in the DAG might represent different jobs, and the edges might represent the dependencies between the jobs.



DAGs have a number of important properties that make them useful in these and other contexts. For example, because they do not contain cycles, they can be used to represent processes that should not be repeated indefinitely. Additionally, because they are directed graphs, they can be used to represent processes in which the order of the steps matters.",1

By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end.

Protein primary structures can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences.",0
ai_954,"A peptide sequence is a linear sequence of amino acid residues that make up a peptide or a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they are joined together by peptide bonds. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its three-dimensional structure and function.

For example, the peptide sequence ""MVHLTPEEK"" represents a peptide containing the amino acids Methionine, Valine, Histidine, Leucine, Threonine, Proline, Glutamic acid, and Lysine.



Peptides can vary in length from just a few amino acids to several hundred. They can be synthesized chemically or produced by the body through the process of protein synthesis.

ID was first developed in the mid-1970s by decision analysts with an intuitive semantic that is easy to understand. It is now adopted widely and becoming an alternative to the decision tree which typically suffers from exponential growth in number of branches with each variable modeled.  ID is directly applicable in team decision analysis, since it allows incomplete sharing of information among team members to be modeled and solved explicitly.  Extensions of ID also find their use in game theory as an alternative representation of the game tree.",0

Influence diagrams are used to represent and analyze decision problems, especially those with multiple decision points and uncertain outcomes. They can be used to visualize the relationships between variables and to analyze the impact of different decisions on the probability of different outcomes.



An influence diagram consists of three types of nodes: decision nodes, chance nodes, and value nodes. Decision nodes represent points at which the decision maker must make a choice. Chance nodes represent uncertain variables that are influenced by other variables or external factors. Value nodes represent the outcomes or payoffs associated with different decisions or combinations of outcomes.



Influence diagrams are a useful tool for decision analysis because they allow the decision maker to clearly represent and analyze the relationships between variables, decisions, and outcomes.

human_957,"In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic (/stoʊˈkæstɪk/) or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics,[10] image processing, signal processing,[11] control theory,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] cryptography[15] and telecommunications.[16] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.[17][18][19]
Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process,[a] used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse,[22] and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time.[23] These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes,[24] and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.[22][25]
The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[26][27] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space.[28][29] The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables.[28][30] But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line.[30] If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead.[31] The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.[29]
Based on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks,[32] martingales,[33] Markov processes,[34] Lévy processes,[35] Gaussian processes,[36] random fields,[37] renewal processes, and branching processes.[38] The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology[39][40][41] as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.[42][43][44] The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics[45] and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.[46][47][48]",0

human_959,"In probability theory and statistics, the multivariate normal distribution, multivariate Gaussian distribution, or joint normal distribution is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions.  One definition is that a random vector is said to be k-variate normally distributed if every linear combination of its k components has a univariate normal distribution. Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem. The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables each of which clusters around a mean value.",0
ai_960,"The multivariate normal distribution, also known as the multivariate Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution for a random vector, whose components are jointly continuous and normally distributed. It is a generalization of the univariate normal distribution, which is the distribution of a single random variable that is normally distributed.



The probability density function (PDF) of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is given by:



$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}|\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|^{1/2}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^\top\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})\right)$$



where $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)^\top$ is the random vector, $n$ is the number of components in the vector, and $|\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|$ is the determinant of the covariance matrix. The mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ determines the location of the distribution, and the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ determines the shape of the distribution.



The multivariate normal distribution is often used in statistical modeling and machine learning, as it is a flexible distribution that can capture a wide range of dependencies between variables. It is also commonly used in Bayesian inference, as the posterior distribution of many Bayesian models is often approximately multivariate normal.",1
human_961,"In probability theory and statistics, the covariance function describes how much two random variables change together (their covariance) with varying spatial or temporal separation. For a random field or stochastic process Z(x) on a domain D, a covariance function C(x, y) gives the covariance of the values of the random field at the two locations x and y:
The same C(x, y) is called the autocovariance function in two instances: in time series (to denote exactly the same concept except that x and y refer to locations in time rather than in space), and in multivariate random fields (to refer to the covariance of a variable with itself, as opposed to the cross covariance between two different variables at different locations, Cov(Z(x1), Y(x2))).",0
ai_962,"In statistics, a covariance function is a function that describes the covariance between two variables as a function of the distance between those variables. In other words, it is a measure of the degree to which two variables are related or vary together.



The covariance between two variables x and y is defined as:



Cov(x, y) = E[(x - E[x])(y - E[y])]



where E[x] is the expected value (mean) of x and E[y] is the expected value of y.



The covariance function can be used to understand the relationship between two variables. If the covariance is positive, it means that the two variables tend to vary together in the same direction (when one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well). If the covariance is negative, it means that the two variables tend to vary in opposite directions (when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease). If the covariance is zero, it means that the two variables are independent and do not have any relationship.



Covariance functions are often used in statistics and machine learning to model the relationships between variables and make predictions. They can also be used to quantify the uncertainty or risk associated with a particular investment or decision.",1
ai_963,"Bayesian optimization is a method for efficiently searching for the optimal value of an unknown function. It is particularly useful for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning models, where the search space is often large and evaluating each point in the space is computationally expensive.



Bayesian optimization works by building a surrogate model of the unknown function using a set of previously evaluated points. This surrogate model is a probabilistic model that represents our current belief about the form of the function. At each step of the optimization process, the Bayesian optimization algorithm selects the next point to evaluate based on the expected improvement in the function value as predicted by the surrogate model.



One of the key advantages of Bayesian optimization is that it can handle constraints and noisy evaluations of the function. It can also incorporate prior knowledge about the form of the function to guide the search.



Overall, Bayesian optimization is a powerful and efficient method for optimizing complex, expensive-to-evaluate functions.",1
human_964,"Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term ""natural selection"", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.
Variation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.
Natural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic
(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.
Natural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.",0
ai_965,"Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature as a result of certain inherited traits being more or less advantageous for an individual's survival and reproduction in a particular environment. These advantageous traits tend to be passed on to future generations, while disadvantageous traits tend to be selected against and are less likely to be passed on. This process ultimately leads to the evolution of species over time.



The theory of natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century, and it remains one of the most important concepts in the field of biology. According to the theory, natural selection occurs because individuals within a population vary in their traits, and some of these traits are more advantageous than others in a particular environment. For example, a population of gazelles that live in a grassland habitat may have individuals with longer legs, which allow them to run faster and escape from predators more effectively. These individuals would be more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, the trait of long legs would be more common in the population over time.



Natural selection is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, and it has shaped the diversity of life on Earth as we know it today.",1
human_966,"In genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, crossover, also called recombination, is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. It is one way to stochastically generate new solutions from an existing population, and is analogous to the crossover that happens during sexual reproduction in biology. Solutions can also be generated by cloning an existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction. Newly generated solutions are typically mutated before being added to the population.
Different algorithms in evolutionary computation may use different data structures to store genetic information, and each genetic representation can be recombined with different crossover operators. Typical data structures that can be recombined with crossover are bit arrays, vectors of real numbers, or trees.",0
ai_967,"In a genetic algorithm, crossover is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to produce offspring that inherits characteristics from both parents. Crossover is a key component of genetic algorithms because it allows the algorithm to mix and recombine the characteristics of different solutions, leading to the discovery of new, potentially better solutions.



Crossover works by selecting a point in the genetic material of the two parents, known as a crossover point, and swapping the genetic material on either side of the point between the two parents to create two new offspring. For example, if the parents have the following genetic material:



Parent 1: [A B C D E F G]

Parent 2: [H I J K L M N]



Crossover point: 4



Offspring 1: [A B C H I J K]

Offspring 2: [D E F L M N G]



In this example, the crossover point is chosen at position 4 in the genetic material of the two parents, and the genetic material on either side of the point is swapped to create two new offspring. Offspring 1 inherits the first four elements from Parent 1 and the last three elements from Parent 2, while Offspring 2 inherits the first three elements from Parent 2 and the last four elements from Parent 1.



Crossover is typically used in combination with other genetic operators, such as mutation, to explore the space of possible solutions and find the best one. By mixing and recombining the genetic material of different solutions, crossover helps the genetic algorithm to discover new, potentially better solutions that may not be obvious by simply mutating a single solution.",1

The goal is to find the best solution to a problem by using the principles of natural selection and genetics to ""evolve"" a population of solutions.



Each chromosome in the population represents a different potential solution to the problem, and the values or symbols in the chromosome represent the specific characteristics of that solution. These characteristics can be thought of as the ""genes"" of the chromosome, and they can be manipulated through the genetic operators in order to explore different combinations of values and find the best solution.



Genetic algorithms are often used to solve optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path between two points or the highest profit in a business model. They are also used in machine learning and data mining applications.",1
human_970,"In computational intelligence (CI), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.
Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.",0
ai_971,"An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a type of optimization algorithm that uses principles inspired by the process of natural evolution to find solutions to problems. EAs are commonly used to find solutions to problems that are too difficult to be solved using traditional algorithms or that have too many variables to be solved using brute force methods.



EAs work by mimicking the process of natural selection and evolution. This process involves the following steps:



Initialization: A population of solutions is generated randomly or using some heuristic method.



Evaluation: The solutions in the population are evaluated based on some predetermined objective function. The objective function measures how well a particular solution fits the problem.



Selection: The solutions in the population are ranked based on their fitness, and the fittest solutions are selected to be used in the next generation.



Reproduction: The selected solutions are used to produce a new generation of solutions through processes such as crossover (combining solutions from different parents) and mutation (randomly altering solutions).



Repeat: The process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found or a predetermined number of iterations have been completed.



EAs are particularly useful for solving problems that are difficult to solve using traditional algorithms because they are able to find good solutions in a relatively short amount of time, even when the problem is very complex. EAs are also able to handle problems with many variables and can find good solutions even when there are multiple conflicting objectives.",1
ai_972,"Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) refers to the use of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents or systems that work together to achieve a common goal or solve a problem. In a DAI system, each agent or system has its own computing resources, knowledge base, and decision-making capabilities, and they communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a shared objective.



One of the main benefits of DAI is that it allows for the distribution of tasks and responsibilities among multiple agents or systems, which can be more efficient and effective than a single centralized system. For example, a DAI system could be used to monitor and control a large, distributed network of devices, such as sensors in an industrial plant or traffic lights in a city. In this case, each device could be equipped with an AI agent that is responsible for monitoring and controlling the device, while the overall system coordinates the actions of the individual agents to achieve a common goal.



DAI can also be used to tackle complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of a single AI system. For example, a group of AI agents working together as a DAI system could be used to analyze and interpret large amounts of data, such as images or text, and extract meaningful insights or make predictions.



Overall, DAI has the potential to enable the development of more sophisticated and capable AI systems that can operate at a larger scale and handle more complex tasks.",1

human_977,"In machine learning, particularly in the creation of artificial neural networks, ensemble averaging is the process of creating multiple models and combining them to produce a desired output, as opposed to creating just one model. Frequently an ensemble of models performs better than any individual model, because the various errors of the models ""average out.""",0
ai_978,"Ensemble averaging is a statistical technique that combines the predictions of multiple models in order to make more accurate predictions. This is often done by training multiple models on the same data and then averaging their predictions.



There are several reasons why ensemble averaging can be useful:



It can help to reduce overfitting: By training multiple models on the same data, each model may be less prone to overfitting to the training data because the models are less likely to learn the same noise or random variations in the data.



It can improve the generalizability of the predictions: By averaging the predictions of multiple models, the ensemble model may be able to better capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to more accurate predictions on unseen data.



It can increase the stability of the predictions: By averaging the predictions of multiple models, the ensemble model may be less sensitive to the specific choice of model or specific configurations of hyperparameters, leading to more stable predictions.



There are several different methods for ensemble averaging, including simple averaging, weighted averaging, and voting. In simple averaging, the predictions of all models are simply averaged together. In weighted averaging, each model's predictions are given a weight based on its performance, and the weighted predictions are averaged together. In voting, each model gets a vote on the final prediction, and the prediction with the most votes is chosen as the ensemble prediction.



Ensemble averaging can be a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and stability of predictions in machine learning and data analysis.",1

human_984,"Fairness in machine learning refers to the various attempts at correcting algorithmic bias in automated decision processes based on machine learning models. Decisions made by computers after a machine-learning process may be considered unfair if they were based on variables considered sensitive. Examples of these kinds of variable include gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and more. As it is the case with many ethical concepts, definitions of fairness and bias are always controversial. In general, fairness and bias are considered relevant when the decision process impacts people's lives. In machine learning, the problem of algorithmic bias is well known and well studied. Outcomes may be skewed by a range of factors and thus might be considered unfair with respect to certain groups or individuals. An example would be the way social media sites deliver personalized news to consumers.",0
ai_985,"In the context of machine learning, fairness refers to the idea that the model should treat all individuals equally and not discriminate against any particular group. This is an important consideration when building machine learning models because these models can sometimes perpetuate or amplify existing biases that are present in the data used to train them.



For example, if a model is trained on data that is biased against a certain group of people, the model may make decisions that disproportionately impact that group in a negative way. This could occur, for example, if the model is used to make decisions about lending, employment, or other opportunities where a person's predicted likelihood of success is used to make decisions about whether or not to provide them with a particular opportunity.



There are a variety of ways in which machine learning models can be made more fair, including techniques such as preprocessing the data to remove or mitigate biases, using different evaluation metrics that are sensitive to fairness, and incorporating fairness constraints into the model training process.

However, this assumption is often dangerously violated in practical high-stake applications, where users may intentionally supply fabricated data that violates the statistical assumption.

human_988,"A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a ""homunculus computer"" —a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.
A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have ""legitimate"" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.
Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system.
Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version.[10]

human_990,"White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system is used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).
White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system–level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Where white-box testing is design-driven, that is, driven exclusively by agreed specifications of how each component of software is required to behave (as in DO-178C and ISO 26262 processes), white-box test techniques can accomplish assessment for unimplemented or missing requirements.
White-box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:",0
ai_991,"White-box testing is a method of testing software in which the tester has complete knowledge of the internal workings and structure of the system being tested. It is often contrasted with black-box testing, in which the tester has no knowledge of the internal structure of the system and only has access to the input and output of the system.



White-box testing is typically used to test specific parts of the software or to verify that certain internal processes are working correctly. It is often used in combination with black-box testing to provide a comprehensive testing strategy.



To perform white-box testing, the tester needs to have a detailed understanding of the code being tested and the algorithms and processes it uses. The tester will create test cases that exercise different parts of the code and verify that the output is correct. This can include testing specific paths through the code, testing edge cases, and testing error handling.



Some of the benefits of white-box testing include the ability to thoroughly test the internal processes of the software, the ability to find hidden or hard-to-detect defects, and the ability to test the code at a very low level. However, it can be time-consuming and may require specialized knowledge or tools.",1
human_992,"In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.
The model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.
Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).
This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.
Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).
Deciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.",0
ai_993,"A test set is a set of data used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is a dataset that is used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data, or to evaluate the model's performance on a specific task. The test set is usually held out from the training data, and is used to evaluate the model's performance after it has been trained on the training data.



The goal of using a test set is to estimate the model's performance on unseen data. This is important because the ultimate goal of machine learning is to build models that can generalize to new data and accurately predict the outcomes of new observations.



To create a test set, you typically split your dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's final performance.



It is important to note that the test set should be representative of the data the model will be used on in the real world. If the test set is not representative of the real-world data, the model's performance on the test set may not accurately reflect its performance in the real world.",1
human_994,"Cross-validation, sometimes called rotation estimation or out-of-sample testing, is any of various similar model validation techniques for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.
Cross-validation is a resampling method that uses different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice.  In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run (training dataset), and a dataset of unknown data (or first seen data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or testing set). The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias[10] and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem).
One round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set). To reduce variability, in most methods multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are combined (e.g. averaged) over the rounds to give an estimate of the model's predictive performance.
In summary, cross-validation combines (averages) measures of fitness in prediction to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance.[11]",0
ai_995,"Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It involves dividing a dataset into a training set, which is used to train the model, and a test set, which is used to evaluate the model. The idea behind cross-validation is to use a portion of the data for training and a different portion for testing, and to repeat this process multiple times in order to get a better estimate of the model's performance.



There are several different types of cross-validation, including:



K-fold cross-validation: In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used as the test set. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold being used as the test set each time. The final performance measure is the average of the performance measures obtained on each of the k folds.



Leave-one-out cross-validation: In leave-one-out cross-validation, the model is trained on all but one of the data points, and the remaining point is used as the test set. This process is repeated for each data point, resulting in k test sets (where k is the number of data points in the dataset). The final performance measure is the average of the performance measures obtained on each of the k test sets.



Stratified k-fold cross-validation: In stratified k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k folds, but the folds are stratified to ensure that each fold has a representative proportion of each class. This is particularly useful when the classes in the dataset are imbalanced (i.e., there are significantly more examples of one class than the other).



Cross-validation is a widely used technique for evaluating the performance of machine learning models because it helps to reduce the risk of overfitting (i.e., the model performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data). By training the model on different subsets of the data and evaluating its performance on different test sets, we can get a more robust estimate of the model's generalization ability.",1
human_996,"Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition. Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered ""positive"" and those for which it is not are considered ""negative"".
If the true condition can not be known, a ""gold standard test"" is assumed to be correct. In a diagnostic test, sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives. For all testing, both diagnostic and screening, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, such that higher sensitivities will mean lower specificities and vice versa.
If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as having the condition, the number of true positives should be high and the number of false negatives should be very low, which results in high sensitivity. This is especially important when the consequence of failing to treat the condition is serious and/or the treatment is very effective and has minimal side effects.
If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as not having the condition, the number of true negatives should be high and the number of false positives should be very low, which results in high specificity. That is, people highly likely to be excluded by the test. This is especially important when people who are identified as having a condition may be subjected to more testing, expense, stigma, anxiety, etc.

ai_997,"In medical testing, sensitivity and specificity are two important measures that are used to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic test.



Sensitivity refers to the proportion of positive cases that are correctly identified by the test. In other words, it is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have the disease or condition. A test with high sensitivity will correctly identify most people with the disease, while a test with low sensitivity will miss many cases of the disease.



Specificity, on the other hand, refers to the proportion of negative cases that are correctly identified by the test. It is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who do not have the disease. A test with high specificity will correctly identify most people who do not have the disease, while a test with low specificity will incorrectly identify many people as having the disease when they do not.



Both sensitivity and specificity are important characteristics of a diagnostic test, as a test with high sensitivity will accurately identify most cases of the disease, while a test with high specificity will accurately rule out most cases where the disease is not present. A test with both high sensitivity and specificity is considered to be a reliable and accurate diagnostic tool.",1
human_998,"In statistics, when performing multiple comparisons, a false positive ratio (also known as fall-out or false alarm ratio) is the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis for a particular test.

The false positive rate (or ""false alarm rate"") usually refers to the expectancy of the false positive ratio.",0
ai_999,"The false positive rate is a measure of the proportion of instances in which a test or other measurement procedure incorrectly indicates the presence of a particular condition or attribute. It is defined as the number of false positive outcomes divided by the total number of negative outcomes.

False positive rate = (Number of false positives) / (Total number of negatives)



A high false positive rate means that the test is prone to giving false positive results, while a low false positive rate means that the test is less likely to give false positive results. The false positive rate is often used in conjunction with the true positive rate (also known as the sensitivity or recall of the test) to evaluate the overall performance of a test or measurement procedure.",1
human_1000,"A false positive is an error in binary classification in which a test result incorrectly indicates the presence of a condition (such as a disease when the disease is not present), while a false negative is the opposite error, where the test result incorrectly indicates the absence of a condition when it is actually present. These are the two kinds of errors in a binary test, in contrast to the two kinds of correct result (a true positive and a true negative). They are also known in medicine as a false positive (or false negative) diagnosis, and in statistical classification as a false positive (or false negative) error.
In statistical hypothesis testing the analogous concepts are known as type I and type II errors, where a positive result corresponds to rejecting the null hypothesis, and a negative result corresponds to not rejecting the null hypothesis. The terms are often used interchangeably, but there are differences in detail and interpretation due to the differences between medical testing and statistical hypothesis testing.",0
ai_1001,"The false negative rate is a measure of the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positive. It is calculated by dividing the number of false negatives by the total number of negatives. False negatives are cases where the test result is negative, but the actual condition is positive.



For example, consider a test for a certain disease. If the test is negative, it means that the person does not have the disease. However, if the person actually does have the disease and the test result is negative, it is a false negative. The false negative rate is the proportion of people who actually have the disease but are incorrectly told they do not have it.



The false negative rate is important because it can affect the accuracy and reliability of a test. A high false negative rate means that the test is not able to detect the condition in many cases where it is actually present, which can lead to missed diagnoses and inadequate treatment. On the other hand, a low false negative rate means that the test is more reliable and accurate in detecting the condition.",1
human_1002,"A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.  The method was originally developed for operators of military radar receivers starting in 1941, which led to its name.
The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection.[10] The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm[10] and can be calculated as (1 − specificity). The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from 



−
∞


{\displaystyle -\infty }

 to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.
ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.
The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, forecasting of natural hazards,[11] meteorology,[12] model performance assessment,[13] and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.
The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.[14]",0
ai_1003,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.

The true positive rate is the number of true positive results divided by the total number of positive results, while the false positive rate is the number of false positive results divided by the total number of negative results.



The ROC curve is a useful tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of different classifier models. A classifier with an ROC curve that is farther to the top left corner of the plot (toward the point (0,1)) is considered to be a better classifier, because it is able to correctly identify more positive cases while also minimizing the number of false positive cases.



In addition to the ROC curve, the area under the curve (AUC) is often used as a metric for evaluating classifier performance. A classifier with an AUC of 1 has perfect discrimination, while a classifier with an AUC of 0.5 has no discrimination ability.

Data collection is an important step in the research process that involves the identification, collection, and analysis of data. It can be done through various methods, such as surveys, experiments, observations, and focus groups.



Data collection is essential for understanding and addressing problems or issues. It helps researchers and organizations make informed decisions by providing a reliable source of information. Data collection can also be used to track progress, identify trends, and evaluate the effectiveness of programs or policies.



There are several types of data collection methods, each with its own strengths and limitations. Choosing the most appropriate method for a particular research project depends on various factors, including the research question, the type of data needed, the resources available, and the time and budget constraints.",1
human_1008,"In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a language resource consisting of a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). In corpus linguistics, they are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory.

ai_1009,"A text corpus is a large and structured set of texts. It is often used in natural language processing and computational linguistics for tasks such as language modeling, text classification, and machine translation.



Text corpora can be compiled for various purposes, such as to study the language use of a particular group or to examine language change over time. They can be compiled from a variety of sources, such as books, newspapers, websites, and spoken transcripts.



Text corpora are often annotated with additional information, such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic parse trees, and named entities. This information can be used to analyze the structure and meaning of the text and to train machine learning models for various natural language processing tasks.

human_1010,"A physical neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse or a higher-order (dendritic) neuron model. ""Physical"" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.",0
ai_1011,"A physical neural network is a system that uses physical components to mimic the behavior of a biological neural network, which is a network of cells called neurons that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. Physical neural networks are typically used in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, and they can be implemented using a variety of technologies, such as electronics, optics, or even mechanical systems.



One example of a physical neural network is an artificial neural network, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. Artificial neural networks are typically implemented using computers and software, and they consist of a series of interconnected nodes, or ""neurons,"" that process and transmit information. Artificial neural networks can be trained to recognize patterns, classify data, and make decisions based on input data, and they are commonly used in applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.



Other examples of physical neural networks include neuromorphic computing systems, which use specialized hardware to mimic the behavior of biological neurons and synapses, and brain-machine interfaces, which use sensors to record the activity of biological neurons and use that information to control external devices or systems.

human_1012,"Neuromorphic engineering, also known as neuromorphic computing, is the use of electronic circuits to mimic neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system. A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons (made from silicon) to do computations. In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet.[11]
A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.
Neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.[12] One of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering was proposed by Carver Mead[13] in the late 1980s.",0

Some of the key areas of focus in neuromorphic engineering include the development of neural networks, brain-inspired computing architectures, and devices that can sense and respond to their environment in a manner similar to how the brain does.



One of the main motivations for neuromorphic engineering is the fact that the human brain is an incredibly efficient information processing system, and researchers believe that by understanding and replicating some of its key features, it may be possible to create computing systems that are more efficient and effective than traditional systems. In addition, neuromorphic engineering has the potential to help us better understand how the brain works and to develop new technologies that could have a wide range of applications in fields such as medicine, robotics, and artificial intelligence.",1
human_1014,"Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be sent to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body.
At a chemical synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules into a small space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are contained within small sacs called synaptic vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Finally, the neurotransmitters are cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or on some other neuroglia to terminate the action of the neurotransmitter.
The adult human brain is estimated to contain from 1014 to 5 × 1014 (100–500 trillion) synapses. Every cubic millimeter of cerebral cortex contains roughly a billion (short scale, i.e. 109) of them. The number of synapses in the  human cerebral cortex has separately been estimated at 0.15 quadrillion (150 trillion)
The word ""synapse"" was introduced by Sir Charles Scott Sherrington in 1897. Chemical synapses are not the only type of biological synapse: electrical and immunological synapses also exist. Without a qualifier, however, ""synapse"" commonly refers to chemical synapse.",0
ai_1015,"A chemical synapse is a type of junction between two neurons or between a neuron and a muscle cell, through which electrical signals are transmitted chemically. It is a specialized intercellular connection that allows one neuron to communicate with another or with a muscle cell.



The process of signal transmission at a chemical synapse begins when an action potential, or nerve impulse, reaches the presynaptic terminal of the sending neuron. This causes the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse, or the small gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. The neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, initiating a response in the form of an electrical signal or a change in the cell's biochemical activity.



Chemical synapses are essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, as they allow for the rapid and precise transmission of signals between neurons and other cells. They are also important for the plasticity of the nervous system, as the strength of the signal transmitted across a chemical synapse can be modified by experience or learning.",1
human_1016,"An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. 
Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints.  Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. In 2009[update], it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.[needs update]
Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).
Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.
Embedded systems range in size from portable personal devices such as digital watches and MP3 players to bigger machines like home appliances, industrial assembly lines, robots, transport vehicles, traffic light controllers, and medical imaging systems. Often they constitute subsystems of other machines like avionics in aircraft and astrionics in spacecraft. Large installations like factories, pipelines and electrical grids rely on multiple embedded systems networked together. Generalized through software customization, embedded systems such as programmable logic controllers frequently comprise their functional units.

human_1018,"A wearable computer, also known as a body-borne computer, is a computing device worn on the body. The definition of 'wearable computer' may be narrow or broad, extending to smartphones or even ordinary wristwatches.
Wearables may be for general use, in which case they are just a particularly small example of mobile computing. Alternatively, they may be for specialized purposes such as fitness trackers. They may incorporate special sensors such as accelerometers, heart rate monitors, or on the more advanced side, electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitors. Under the definition of wearable computers, we also include novel user interfaces such as Google Glass, an optical head-mounted display controlled by gestures.

human_1020,"Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware designed to perform specific functions more efficiently when compared to software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data that can be calculated in software running on a generic CPU can also be calculated in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both.
To perform computing tasks more quickly (or better in some other way), generally one can invest time and money in improving the software, improving the hardware, or both. There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).
Hardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.[10] The disadvantage however, is that in many open source projects, it requires proprietary libraries that not all vendors are keen to distribute or expose, making it difficult to integrate in such projects.",0
ai_1021,"Hardware acceleration refers to the use of computer hardware, specifically hardware designed to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). By using hardware acceleration, a computer can perform certain tasks faster and more efficiently than it could with just a CPU.



Hardware acceleration is often used in graphics and video processing, as these tasks can be very resource-intensive and can benefit greatly from specialized hardware. For example, a graphics processing unit (GPU) is a type of hardware designed specifically to handle the complex calculations required to render images and video. By offloading these tasks to the GPU, the CPU is free to perform other tasks, resulting in improved overall performance.



Hardware acceleration can also be used in other areas, such as data processing, encryption, and network communication. In these cases, specialized hardware such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) may be used to perform certain tasks more efficiently than a CPU.

human_1022,"Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm for energy-efficient and/or high-performance design. It includes a plethora of computation techniques that return a possibly inaccurate result rather than a guaranteed accurate result, and that can be used for applications where an approximate result is sufficient for its purpose. One example of such situation is for a search engine where no exact answer may exist for a certain search query and hence, many answers may be acceptable. Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.[clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.
The key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output.",0
ai_1023,"Approximate computing is a computing paradigm that involves intentionally introducing errors or uncertainty into computing systems in order to reduce resource consumption or improve performance. In approximate computing, the goal is not to achieve the most accurate or precise results, but rather to find a satisfactory solution that is good enough for the given task at hand.



Approximate computing can be applied at various levels of the computing stack, including hardware, software, and algorithms. At the hardware level, approximate computing can involve the use of low-precision or error-prone components in order to reduce power consumption or increase the speed of computation. At the software level, approximate computing can involve the use of algorithms that trade off accuracy for efficiency, or the use of heuristics or approximations to solve problems more quickly.



Approximate computing has a number of potential applications, including in embedded systems, mobile devices, and high-performance computing. It can also be used to design more efficient machine learning algorithms and systems. However, the use of approximate computing also carries some risks, as it can result in errors or inconsistencies in the results of computation.

human_1025,"In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent (IA) is anything which perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or may use knowledge. They may be simple or complex — a thermostat is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.
Leading AI textbooks define ""artificial intelligence"" as the ""study and design of intelligent agents"", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, ""rational agent"".
An agent has an ""objective function"" that encapsulates all the IA's goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a ""reward function"" that allows the programmers to shape the IA's desired behavior, and an evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a ""fitness function"".
Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations. 
Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).",0

human_1027,"Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding a control for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized. It has numerous applications in science, engineering and operations research. For example, the dynamical system might be a spacecraft with controls corresponding to rocket thrusters, and the objective might be to reach the moon with minimum fuel expenditure. Or the dynamical system could be a nation's economy, with the objective to minimize unemployment; the controls in this case could be fiscal and monetary policy. A dynamical system may also be introduced to embed operations research problems within the framework of optimal control theory.
Optimal control is an extension of the calculus of variations, and is a mathematical optimization method for deriving control policies. The method is largely due to the work of Lev Pontryagin and Richard Bellman in the 1950s, after contributions to calculus of variations by Edward J. McShane. Optimal control can be seen as a control strategy in control theory.",0
ai_1028,"Optimal control theory is a mathematical optimization method used to find the control inputs (often called ""controls"" or ""control actions"") that yield the best possible performance for a given system, subject to certain constraints. It is a branch of control theory that deals with the optimization of control systems.



In optimal control problems, we aim to find a control strategy that minimizes or maximizes some performance measure over a given time horizon. The performance measure is often a cost function, which represents the trade-off between the benefits of good performance and the costs of applying the controls. The time horizon is the period over which the control inputs are applied and the system's performance is evaluated.



Optimal control theory is used in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, and computer science. It has applications in areas such as manufacturing, transportation, finance, and robotics. Some examples of optimal control problems include:



A manufacturing process that aims to minimize production costs while meeting certain quality standards

A self-driving car that aims to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining a safe and efficient driving speed

An investment portfolio that aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk

Optimal control theory is based on the idea of dynamic optimization, which involves finding the optimal solution to a problem that involves time-varying variables. The optimal solution is the one that maximizes or minimizes the performance measure over the time horizon. To find the optimal solution, we often use optimization algorithms or mathematical techniques such as calculus of variations or dynamic programming.

human_1029,"Bounded rationality is the idea that rationality is limited when individuals make decisions, and under these limitations, rational individuals will select a decision that is satisfactory rather than optimal.
Limitations include the difficulty of the problem requiring a decision, the cognitive capability of the mind, and the time available to make the decision. Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution, with everything that they have at the moment rather than an optimal solution. Therefore, humans do not undertake a full cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision, but rather, choose an option that fulfils their adequacy criteria. An example of this being within organisations when they must adhere to the operating conditions of their company, this has the opportunity to result in bounded rationality as the organisation is not able to choose the optimal option.
Some models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be reasonably approximated or described as ""rational"" entities, as in rational choice theory or Downs' political agency model. The concept of bounded rationality complements ""rationality as optimization"", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Therefore, bounded rationality can be said to address the discrepancy between the assumed perfect rationality of human behaviour (which is utilised by other economics theories such as the Neoclassical approach), and the reality of human cognition.  In short, bounded rationality revises notions of ""perfect"" rationality to account for the fact that perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for making them. The concept of bounded rationality continues to influence (and be debated in) different disciplines, including political science, economics, psychology, law and cognitive science.",0
ai_1030,"Bounded rationality is a concept in behavioral economics and decision-making that suggests that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the cognitive and emotional constraints of their minds. This means that people's decision-making is not always fully rational or logical, but rather is influenced by their biases, emotions, and other mental limitations.



The concept of bounded rationality was developed by economist Herbert Simon in the 1950s and suggests that people's decision-making is not always fully consistent with the ideal of rationality as defined in traditional economics. Instead, people's decision-making is shaped by their limited cognitive abilities and the information that is available to them.



Bounded rationality is an important concept in understanding how people make decisions in real-world situations, as it acknowledges that people's decision-making is not always fully rational or based on complete information. It is also an important consideration in fields such as management and public policy, where decision-making is often based on incomplete or uncertain information.",1
human_1031,"In decision theory, on making decisions under uncertainty—should information about the best course of action arrive after taking a fixed decision—the human emotional response of regret is often experienced, and can be measured as the value of difference between a made decision and the optimal decision. 
The theory of regret aversion or anticipated regret proposes that when facing a decision, individuals might anticipate regret and thus incorporate in their choice their desire to eliminate or reduce this possibility. Regret is a negative emotion with a powerful social and reputational component, and is central to how humans learn from experience and to the human psychology of risk aversion. Conscious anticipation of regret creates a feedback loop that transcends regret from the emotional realm—often modeled as mere human behavior—into the realm of the rational choice behavior that is modeled in decision theory.",0
ai_1032,"In game theory, regret is the feeling of remorse or disappointment that a player experiences when they realize that they could have made a different decision that would have led to a better outcome. Regret is often used as a measure of the quality of a decision-making process, with decisions that result in low regret being considered to be more rational or optimal than those that result in high regret.



One common way to measure regret is to compare the outcome of a decision to the outcome that would have resulted if the player had made a different decision. For example, if a player chooses to play a certain strategy in a game and the outcome is not as good as they had hoped, they may experience regret if they realize that they could have chosen a different strategy that would have led to a better outcome.



Regret can be a useful concept in game theory because it helps to quantify the cost of making a suboptimal decision. It can also be used to analyze how a player's decision-making process changes over time, as players may learn from their mistakes and adjust their strategies to avoid experiencing regret in the future.",1

There are many approaches to robot control, ranging from simple pre-programmed behaviors to complex machine learning-based approaches. Some common techniques used in robot control include:



Deterministic control: This involves designing a control system based on precise mathematical models of the robot and its environment. The control system calculates the required actions for the robot to perform a given task and executes them in a predictable manner.



Adaptive control: This involves designing a control system that can adjust its behavior based on the current state of the robot and its environment. Adaptive control systems are useful in situations where the robot must operate in unknown or changing environments.



Nonlinear control: This involves designing a control system that can handle systems with nonlinear dynamics, such as robots with flexible joints or payloads. Nonlinear control techniques can be more complex to design, but can be more effective in certain situations.



Machine learning-based control: This involves using machine learning algorithms to enable the robot to learn how to perform a task through trial and error. The robot is provided with a set of input-output examples and learns to map inputs to outputs through a process of training.

human_1035,"The elevator algorithm (also SCAN) is a disk-scheduling algorithm to determine the motion of the disk's arm and head in servicing read and write requests.
This algorithm is named after the behavior of a building elevator, where the elevator continues to travel in its current direction (up or down) until empty, stopping only to let individuals off or to pick up new individuals heading in the same direction.  
From an implementation perspective, the drive maintains a buffer of pending read/write requests, along with the associated cylinder number of the request, in which lower cylinder numbers generally indicate that the cylinder is closer to the spindle, and higher numbers indicate the cylinder is farther away.",0
ai_1036,"The elevator algorithm is a scheduling algorithm used in computer operating systems to optimize the movement of the hard drive read/write head, which is also known as the disk arm, to reduce the time it takes to access data stored on a hard drive. The algorithm works by predicting which data the system is likely to need next, and positioning the read/write head over that data in advance, so that it can be accessed more quickly.



Here's how the algorithm works:



When a request is made to read or write data from a specific location on the hard drive, the operating system uses the elevator algorithm to determine the optimal position for the read/write head.



The algorithm takes into account the current position of the head, the direction it is moving (up or down the disk), and the location of the requested data.



If the data is in the same direction as the head is moving, the head will continue moving in that direction until it reaches the data.



If the data is in the opposite direction from the head, the head will stop at the nearest track, wait for the disk to rotate under it, and then start moving in the opposite direction.



Once the head reaches the data, it will access the data and then continue moving in the same direction until it reaches the end of the disk, or until it receives another request.



The elevator algorithm is designed to minimize the time it takes to access data on the hard drive by reducing the amount of time the head has to spend moving back and forth across the disk. This can significantly improve the performance of the system, particularly when accessing large files or when performing multiple read/write operations in quick succession.",1
human_1037,"In probability theory and machine learning, the multi-armed bandit problem (sometimes called the K- or N-armed bandit problem) is a problem in which a fixed limited set of resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation, and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice. This is a classic reinforcement learning problem that exemplifies the exploration–exploitation tradeoff dilemma. The name comes from imagining a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as ""one-armed bandits""), who has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, and whether to continue with the current machine or try a different machine. The multi-armed bandit problem also falls into the broad category of stochastic scheduling.
In the problem, each machine provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that machine, that is not known a-priori. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls. The crucial tradeoff the gambler faces at each trial is between ""exploitation"" of the machine that has the highest expected payoff and ""exploration"" to get more information about the expected payoffs of the other machines. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is also faced in machine learning. In practice, multi-armed bandits have been used to model problems such as managing research projects in a large organization, like a science foundation or a pharmaceutical company. In early versions of the problem, the gambler begins with no initial knowledge about the machines.
Herbert Robbins in 1952, realizing the importance of the problem, constructed convergent population selection strategies in ""some aspects of the sequential design of experiments"". A theorem, the Gittins index, first published by John C. Gittins, gives an optimal policy for maximizing the expected discounted reward.",0
ai_1038,"The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic problem in the field of reinforcement learning. It refers to a situation in which a decision-maker, or an ""agent,"" must choose among several options, or ""arms,"" in order to maximize a reward. Each arm is associated with a probability distribution over rewards, and the agent does not know the reward distributions for the different arms. Instead, the agent must learn about the reward distributions through trial and error.



The problem is called a ""bandit"" problem because the agent is faced with a trade-off between exploration, or trying out different arms to learn more about their reward distributions, and exploitation, or choosing the arm that has the highest expected reward based on the current knowledge of the reward distributions. The goal of the agent is to find the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, in order to maximize the cumulative reward over time.



The multi-armed bandit problem is a simple but powerful model that has been used to study a wide range of decision-making problems, including online advertising, clinical trials, and resource allocation. It has also been used to study the behavior of humans and animals in similar situations.",1
human_1039,"In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search, also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.
A brute-force algorithm that finds the divisors of a natural number n would enumerate all integers from 1 to n, and check whether each of them divides n without remainder. A brute-force approach for the eight queens puzzle would examine all possible arrangements of 8 pieces on the 64-square chessboard and for each arrangement, check whether each (queen) piece can attack any other.
While a brute-force search is simple to implement and will always find a solution if it exists, implementation costs are proportional to the number of candidate solutions – which in many practical problems tends to grow very quickly as the size of the problem increases (§Combinatorial explosion). Therefore, brute-force search is typically used when the problem size is limited, or when there are problem-specific heuristics that can be used to reduce the set of candidate solutions to a manageable size. The method is also used when the simplicity of implementation is more important than speed.
This is the case, for example, in critical applications where any errors in the algorithm would have very serious consequences or when using a computer to prove a mathematical theorem. Brute-force search is also useful as a baseline method when benchmarking other algorithms or metaheuristics. Indeed, brute-force search can be viewed as the simplest metaheuristic. Brute force search should not be confused with backtracking, where large sets of solutions can be discarded without being explicitly enumerated (as in the textbook computer solution to the eight queens problem above). The brute-force method for finding an item in a table – namely, check all entries of the latter, sequentially – is called linear search.",0
ai_1040,"Brute-force search is a simple and straightforward method of finding a solution to a problem by trying every possible option until the correct one is found. It is a type of algorithmic approach that involves systematically enumerating all possible solutions and checking whether each one satisfies the problem's requirements.



Brute-force search is often used when no other method is known, or when the problem is small enough that the sheer number of possibilities is not prohibitive. However, it can be very time-consuming and is generally not practical for larger problems, as the number of possibilities can quickly become very large.



For example, suppose you are trying to find the combination to a safe and you know that it is a 4-digit code. You could use brute-force search by trying every possible combination of 4 digits until you find the correct one. This would be a very time-consuming process, but it would guarantee that you would eventually find the correct combination.



In computer science, brute-force search is often used as a baseline or reference point when comparing the performance of other algorithms. It is also sometimes used as a way of finding approximate solutions to problems when an exact solution is not required or is too expensive to compute.",1

In value iteration, the agent iteratively improves its estimate of the optimal value function for the MDP. The value function for an MDP is a mathematical representation of the expected long-term rewards that the agent can expect to receive from a given state. The goal of value iteration is to find the value function that will maximize the expected long-term rewards for the agent.



To do this, value iteration uses the Bellman equation, which expresses the relationship between the value of a state and the values of its possible successor states. The Bellman equation states that the value of a state is the sum of the immediate reward for being in that state and the discounted expected value of the successor states.



In value iteration, the agent starts with an initial estimate of the value function and then iteratively improves this estimate by using the Bellman equation to update the values of the states based on the values of their successor states. This process continues until the value function converges to the optimal value function for the MDP.

ai_1044,"Policy iteration is an algorithm for finding an optimal policy in a Markov decision process (MDP). MDPs are a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making problems, where an agent takes actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward.



The policy iteration algorithm works by alternating between two steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement.



In the policy evaluation step, the algorithm estimates the value of each state under the current policy, using a value iteration algorithm. This involves iteratively updating the values of each state until they converge to the expected return of the current policy.



In the policy improvement step, the algorithm updates the policy based on the values calculated in the policy evaluation step. This involves choosing the action that maximizes the expected return at each state, resulting in a new, improved policy.



The algorithm continues to alternate between these two steps until the policy converges to the optimal policy. The optimal policy is the policy that maximizes the expected return for all states in the MDP.



Policy iteration is a useful algorithm for solving MDPs because it can find the optimal policy even if the transition probabilities and rewards are not known. It is also relatively efficient, with a computational complexity of O(n^2) for an MDP with n states. However, it may require a large number of iterations to converge, especially for large or complex MDPs.",1
human_1045,"Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.
In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean–Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases).
Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc.), Monte Carlo–based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative ""soft"" methods.
In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the 'sample mean') of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parameterized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.
In other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see McKean–Vlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann–Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain.[10] A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample multiple copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and MCMC methodologies, these mean-field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes.
Despite its conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, the computational cost associated with a Monte Carlo simulation can be staggeringly high. In general the method requires many samples to get a good approximation, which may incur an arbitrarily large total runtime if the processing time of a single sample is high.[11] Although this is a severe limitation in very complex problems, the embarrassingly parallel nature of the algorithm allows this large cost to be reduced (perhaps to a feasible level) through parallel computing strategies in local processors, clusters, cloud computing, GPU, FPGA, etc.[12][13][14][15]",0
ai_1046,"Monte Carlo sampling is a technique used in computer simulations to generate random samples from a multivariate distribution. It is named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, where randomness is a key feature of many games of chance.



In Monte Carlo sampling, random numbers are generated and used to sample values from the distribution of interest. This process is repeated multiple times to generate a large number of samples, which can then be used to estimate various statistical properties of the distribution, such as the mean, variance, and distribution of the samples.



Monte Carlo sampling is often used in statistical modeling, machine learning, and other fields where the goal is to estimate some quantity based on random samples from a complex distribution. It is particularly useful for modeling systems with many variables or for approximating difficult integrals.



One of the key advantages of Monte Carlo sampling is that it is easy to implement and can be used with any multivariate distribution. It is also relatively fast, especially when compared to more computationally intensive methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, it is subject to the ""law of large numbers,"" which means that the accuracy of the estimates obtained through Monte Carlo sampling depends on the number of samples generated. As a result, it is important to generate a sufficient number of samples to achieve good accuracy.",1
human_1047,"In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need, is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations (sharing).
The benefits of lazy evaluation include: 
Lazy evaluation is often combined with memoization, as described in Jon Bentley's Writing Efficient Programs. After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.
Lazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate. 
The opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation. Eager evaluation is the evaluation strategy employed in most[quantify] programming languages.",0
ai_1048,"Lazy evaluation is a strategy used in computer programming to delay the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This approach is often used to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations, and it can also be used to facilitate the creation of infinite data structures.



In many programming languages, expressions are evaluated as soon as they are encountered during the execution of a program. However, with lazy evaluation, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until it is actually required. This can be accomplished through the use of special constructs, such as lazy variables or lazy functions, which are evaluated only when they are accessed or called.



One common use of lazy evaluation is to improve the performance of a program by avoiding the computation of unnecessary values. For example, if a program needs to perform a computation that involves a large data set, it may be more efficient to use lazy evaluation to compute only the values that are actually needed, rather than computing the entire data set and then discarding the unused values.



Lazy evaluation can also be used to create infinite data structures, such as streams or lists that can be traversed indefinitely. In these cases, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until the next value in the data structure is needed, allowing the data structure to be constructed on the fly as it is traversed.



Overall, lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the performance and expressiveness of a program by allowing it to compute only the values that are actually needed.",1
human_1049,"Temporal difference (TD) learning refers to a class of model-free reinforcement learning methods which learn by bootstrapping from the current estimate of the value function. These methods sample from the environment, like Monte Carlo methods, and perform updates based on current estimates, like dynamic programming methods.
While Monte Carlo methods only adjust their estimates once the final outcome is known, TD methods adjust predictions to match later, more accurate, predictions about the future before the final outcome is known. This is a form of bootstrapping, as illustrated with the following example:
Temporal difference methods are related to the temporal difference model of animal learning.",0
ai_1050,"Temporal difference (TD) learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn about the expected future rewards of an agent's actions in a Markov decision process (MDP). It is a type of model-free reinforcement learning, which means that it does not require a model of the environment or its transitions in order to learn.



In TD learning, the agent estimates the value of each state or action by using a temporal difference error (TD error) to update its value function. The TD error is calculated as the difference between the expected reward for an action and the actual reward received. This error is then used to update the value function, which guides the agent's decisions about which actions to take in the future.



TD learning can be used to learn value functions for both state values (the expected future reward of being in a particular state) and action values (the expected future reward of taking a particular action). It can also be used to learn about the expected future rewards of policies, which are sets of actions that the agent follows in different states.



TD learning has several advantages over other reinforcement learning algorithms. It is simple to implement, and it can learn online, meaning that it can update its value function as it receives new rewards and transitions. It is also effective at handling delayed rewards, which are common in many real-world environments.",1
human_1051,"A Bellman equation, named after Richard E. Bellman, is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as dynamic programming. It writes the ""value"" of a decision problem at a certain point in time in terms of the payoff from some initial choices and the ""value"" of the remaining decision problem that results from those initial choices.[citation needed] This breaks a dynamic optimization problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems, as Bellman's “principle of optimality"" prescribes.  The equation applies to algebraic structures with a total ordering; for algebraic structures with a partial ordering, the generic Bellman's equation can be used.
The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering control theory and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in economic theory; though the basic concepts of dynamic programming are prefigured in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior and Abraham Wald's sequential analysis.[citation needed] The term 'Bellman equation' usually refers to the dynamic programming equation associated with discrete-time optimization problems. In continuous-time optimization problems, the analogous equation is a partial differential equation that is called the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation.
In discrete time any multi-stage optimization problem can be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The appropriate Bellman equation can be found by introducing new state variables (state augmentation). However, the resulting augmented-state multi-stage optimization problem has a higher dimensional state space than the original multi-stage optimization problem - an issue that can potentially render the augmented problem intractable due to the “curse of dimensionality”. Alternatively, it has been shown that if the cost function of the multi-stage optimization problem satisfies a ""backward separable"" structure, then the appropriate Bellman equation can be found without state augmentation.",0
ai_1052,"The Bellman equation is a mathematical equation that is used to describe the dynamic programming solution to a particular optimization problem. It is named after Richard Bellman, who introduced the concept of dynamic programming in the 1950s.



In dynamic programming, we seek to find the optimal solution to a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, solving each of those subproblems, and then combining the solutions to the subproblems to get the overall optimal solution. The Bellman equation is a key tool for solving dynamic programming problems because it provides a way to express the optimal solution to a subproblem in terms of the optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.



The general form of the Bellman equation is as follows:



V(S) = max[R(S,A) + γV(S')]



Here, V(S) is the value of being in state S, R(S,A) is the reward for taking action A in state S, γ is a discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards, and V(S') is the value of the next state (S') that results from taking action A in state S. The term ""max"" indicates that we are trying to find the maximum value of V(S) by considering all possible actions A that can be taken in state S.



The Bellman equation can be used to solve a wide variety of optimization problems, including problems in economics, control theory, and machine learning. It is particularly useful for solving problems involving decision-making over time, where the optimal decision at each step depends on the decisions made in previous steps.",1

A fuzzy rule typically consists of a condition part, which specifies the input variables, and a conclusion part, which specifies the output variable. The condition part of the rule is usually written in the form of an if-then statement, and the conclusion part is written in the form of a then-statement.



For example, a simple fuzzy rule might be:



If the temperature is hot, then the air conditioning should be turned on.



In this example, the input variable is the temperature, and the output variable is the state of the air conditioning. The condition part of the rule specifies that if the temperature is hot, then the conclusion part of the rule should be followed, which is to turn the air conditioning on.



Fuzzy rules can be used in combination with other techniques, such as fuzzy inference systems, to make decisions or control systems based on input data that may be imprecise or uncertain. They are often used in situations where traditional, Boolean logic (true/false) approaches may not be sufficient, and can be useful in modeling complex systems that involve multiple, interacting variables.",1

human_1068,"The visual system comprises the sensory organ (the eye) and parts of the central nervous system (the retina containing photoreceptor cells, the optic nerve, the optic tract and the visual cortex) which gives organisms the sense of sight (the ability to detect and process visible light) as well as enabling the formation of several non-image photo response functions. It detects and interprets information from the optical spectrum perceptible to that species to ""build a representation"" of the surrounding environment. The visual system carries out a number of complex tasks, including the reception of light and the formation of monocular neural representations, colour vision, the neural mechanisms underlying stereopsis and assessment of distances to and between objects, the identification of a particular object of interest, motion perception, the analysis and integration of visual information, pattern recognition, accurate motor coordination under visual guidance, and more.  The neuropsychological side of visual information processing is known as visual perception, an abnormality of which is called visual impairment, and a complete absence of which is called blindness.  Non-image forming visual functions, independent of visual perception, include (among others) the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment.
This article mostly describes the visual system of mammals, humans in particular, although other animals have similar visual systems (see bird vision, vision in fish, mollusc eye, and reptile vision).",0
ai_1069,"The human visual system is the part of the human nervous system that allows us to see. It is responsible for processing the information that we receive through our eyes and turning it into images that we can understand.



The visual system begins with the eyes, which are the primary organs of vision. The eyes contain light-sensitive cells called rods and cones that detect light and color. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and the pupil, which controls the amount of light that enters the eye. The light then passes through the lens, which focuses it onto the retina at the back of the eye.



The retina is a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye and contains millions of photoreceptor cells. These cells, called rods and cones, convert the light that they receive into electrical signals. These signals are then sent through the optic nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as images.



The visual system also includes the brain, which is responsible for processing and interpreting the information that is received from the eyes. The brain receives input from the eyes and processes it in the occipital lobe, which is the part of the brain that is responsible for vision. The brain then uses this information to create a visual image that we can understand.



Overall, the human visual system is a complex and highly integrated system that allows us to see and interpret the world around us.",1
human_1070,"An image sensor or imager is a sensor that detects and conveys information used to make an image. It does so by converting the variable attenuation of light waves (as they pass through or reflect off objects) into signals, small bursts of current that convey the information. The waves can be light or other electromagnetic radiation. Image sensors are used in electronic imaging devices of both analog and digital types, which include digital cameras, camera modules, camera phones, optical mouse devices, medical imaging equipment, night vision equipment such as thermal imaging devices, radar, sonar, and others. As technology changes, electronic and digital imaging tends to replace chemical and analog imaging.
The two main types of electronic image sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) and the active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor). Both CCD and CMOS sensors are based on metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology, with CCDs based on MOS capacitors and CMOS sensors based on MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) amplifiers. Analog sensors for invisible radiation tend to involve vacuum tubes of various kinds, while digital sensors include flat-panel detectors.",0
ai_1071,"An image sensor is a device that converts an optical image into an electronic signal. It is used in digital cameras, scanners, and other image-capturing devices to capture and record images.



An image sensor consists of a matrix of photodiodes, which are light-sensitive elements that convert light into an electrical current. When light enters the camera and hits the image sensor, it is absorbed by the photodiodes, which generate an electrical current proportional to the intensity of the light. The image sensor converts this electrical current into digital data, which is then processed by the camera's image processing unit to produce a digital image.



There are two main types of image sensors: CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor). CCD sensors are generally more expensive to manufacture, but they produce higher quality images with less noise. CMOS sensors are less expensive to manufacture and consume less power, but they may produce images with more noise.



In summary, an image sensor is a crucial component of any image-capturing device, as it converts the light that enters the device into a digital representation of the scene that can be stored and manipulated.",1

The trained model can then be used to predict the presence and location of objects in new images or videos.



Object detection can be distinguished from object recognition, which involves identifying the type of an object from among a predefined set of categories.

The snakes model is popular in computer vision, and snakes are widely used in applications like object tracking, shape recognition, segmentation, edge detection and stereo matching.
A snake is an energy minimizing, deformable spline influenced by constraint and image forces that pull it towards object contours and internal forces that resist deformation. Snakes may be understood as a special case of the general technique of matching a deformable model to an image by means of energy minimization. In two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learnt from a training set.
Snakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand. Rather, they depend on other mechanisms such as interaction with a user, interaction with some higher level image understanding process, or information from image data adjacent in time or space.",0

It is a flexible curve that can be deformed to fit the contours of an object by minimizing an energy functional. The curve is initialized around the object, and then it is iteratively modified to minimize the energy functional, which typically consists of an internal energy term that encourages the curve to have a smooth and regular shape, and an external energy term that drives the curve towards the desired object.



The energy functional can be designed to incorporate prior knowledge about the shape and appearance of the object, and can be optimized using optimization techniques such as gradient descent or the Newton-Raphson method. The active contour model can be used to segment a wide range of objects, including objects with complex shapes and those with significant variations in their appearance.

human_1098,"In the domain of physics and probability, a Markov random field (MRF), Markov network or undirected graphical model is a set of random variables having a Markov property described by an undirected graph. In other words, a random field is said to be a Markov random field if it satisfies Markov properties. The concept originates from the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model.
A Markov network or MRF is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies[further explanation needed]); on the other hand, it can't represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies[further explanation needed]). The underlying graph of a Markov random field may be finite or infinite.
When the joint probability density of the random variables is strictly positive, it is also referred to as a Gibbs random field, because, according to the Hammersley–Clifford theorem, it can then be represented by a Gibbs measure for an appropriate (locally defined) energy function. The prototypical Markov random field is the Ising model; indeed, the Markov random field was introduced as the general setting for the Ising model. In the domain of artificial intelligence, a Markov random field is used to model various low- to mid-level tasks in image processing and computer vision.",0
ai_1099,"A Markov random field (MRF) is a type of probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their statistical dependencies through a graph. In an MRF, each variable is associated with a node in the graph, and the presence or absence of an edge between two nodes indicates the presence or absence of a statistical dependency between the corresponding variables.



The probabilistic graphical model associated with an MRF is called a Markov network. Markov random fields are used to model complex systems in which the variables are related to one another through a set of statistical dependencies, and they have found applications in many areas, including image processing, natural language processing, and machine learning.



One of the key properties of MRFs is the Markov property, which states that the probability distribution of a random variable is determined solely by its neighbors in the graph. This property allows MRFs to capture the dependencies between variables in a compact and efficient way.



Markov random fields can be defined in terms of their energy function, which is a mathematical expression that describes the energy or cost associated with a particular configuration of the variables. The probability distribution of the variables in an MRF can be obtained from the energy function using the principle of maximum entropy, which states that the most likely configuration of the variables is the one that maximizes the entropy of the system.",1
human_1100,"In mathematics, projective geometry is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations. This means that, compared to elementary Euclidean geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called ""points at infinity"") to Euclidean points, and vice-versa.
Properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle is an example of a concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.
While the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a development of the 19th century. This included the theory of complex projective space, the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including invariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein's Erlangen programme resulting in the study of the classical groups) were motivated by projective geometry. It was also a subject with many practitioners for its own sake, as synthetic geometry. Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is finite geometry.

Projective transformations are used to map figures from one projective space to another, and these transformations preserve certain properties of the figures, such as ratios of lengths and the cross-ratio of four points.



Projective geometry is a non-metric geometry, meaning that it does not rely on the concept of distance. Instead, it is based on the idea of a ""projection,"" which is a mapping of points and lines from one space onto another. Projective transformations can be used to map figures from one projective space to another, and these transformations preserve certain properties of the figures, such as ratios of lengths and the cross-ratio of four points.

human_1102,"Camera resectioning is the process of estimating the parameters of a pinhole camera model approximating the camera that produced a given photograph or video; it determines which incoming light ray is associated with each pixel on the resulting image. Basically, the process determines the pose of the pinhole camera.
Usually, the camera parameters are represented in a 3 × 4 projection matrix called the camera matrix.
The extrinsic parameters define the camera pose (position and orientation) while the intrinsic parameters specify the camera image format (focal length, pixel size, and image origin).
This process is often called geometric camera calibration or simply camera calibration, although that term may also refer to photometric camera calibration or be restricted for the estimation of the intrinsic parameters only. Exterior orientation and interior orientation refer to the determination of only the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters, respectively.
The classic camera calibration requires special objects in the scene, which is not required in camera auto-calibration.
Camera resectioning is often used in the application of stereo vision where the camera projection matrices of two cameras are used to calculate the 3D world coordinates of a point viewed by both cameras.",0
ai_1103,"Camera resectioning is the process of determining the position and orientation of a camera in relation to a scene, given a set of known 3D points in the scene and their corresponding 2D image projections in the camera's image plane.



In other words, given a set of 3D points in the world and their corresponding 2D coordinates in an image taken by the camera, camera resectioning estimates the pose (position and orientation) of the camera at the time the image was taken. This is often done using computer vision techniques and can be useful for a variety of applications, such as augmented reality, 3D reconstruction, and robot localization.



To perform camera resectioning, it is typically necessary to have a known set of 3D points in the scene and their corresponding 2D projections in the image. These points are often called ""control points"" or ""feature points."" The process of determining the position and orientation of the camera involves solving a system of equations that relates the 3D coordinates of the control points to their 2D projections in the image. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including linear least squares and nonlinear optimization methods.



Once the camera's pose has been determined, it is possible to use this information to reconstruct a 3D model of the scene, to perform augmented reality tasks, or to localize the camera in relation to other objects or landmarks in the environment.",1
human_1104,"In photogrammetry and computer stereo vision, bundle adjustment is simultaneous refining of the 3D coordinates describing the scene geometry, the parameters of the relative motion, and the optical characteristics of the camera(s) employed to acquire the images, given a set of images depicting a number of 3D points from different viewpoints.
Its name refers to the geometrical bundles of light rays originating from each 3D feature and converging on each camera's optical center, which are adjusted optimally according to an optimality criterion involving the corresponding image projections of all points.",0
ai_1105,"Bundle adjustment is a method used to jointly optimize the parameters of a set of interrelated variables, in order to minimize the error between a set of observations and a set of predictions or a model. It is commonly used in computer vision and photogrammetry to refine the estimated positions of cameras and points in 3D space, based on a set of images and corresponding 2D point correspondences.



In the context of computer vision, bundle adjustment is typically used to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D geometry and camera pose estimates. For example, in structure from motion (SfM) or multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms, bundle adjustment is used to refine the estimated positions of the cameras and 3D points in the scene, based on their projections in the images.



Bundle adjustment is an iterative optimization process that involves computing the residual error between the observations and the model predictions, and adjusting the model parameters to minimize this error. The optimization process is typically carried out using techniques such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm or Gauss-Newton algorithm.



Bundle adjustment is a computationally intensive process, and the accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the initial estimates and the amount of available data. However, it is an important step in many computer vision and photogrammetry applications, as it can significantly improve the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D geometry and camera pose estimates.",1
human_1106,"In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects (sets of pixels). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.
The result of image segmentation is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted from the image (see edge detection). Each of the pixels in a region are similar with respect to some characteristic or computed property
, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions are significantly different color respect to the same characteristic(s). When applied to a stack of images, typical in medical imaging, the resulting contours after image segmentation can be used to create 3D reconstructions with the help of interpolation algorithms like marching cubes.",0
ai_1107,"Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which corresponds to a different object or background. It is an important task in image processing and computer vision, as it allows for the extraction of meaningful information from images and the separation of objects from their backgrounds.



There are several different approaches to image segmentation, including:



Thresholding: This is a simple but effective method of image segmentation that involves setting a threshold value for pixel intensity. Pixels that are above the threshold are assigned to one region, while pixels below the threshold are assigned to another region.



Edge detection: This method involves identifying the edges or boundaries of objects in an image. Edges are typically defined as locations where there is a significant change in pixel intensity, and can be detected using algorithms such as the Sobel operator or the Canny edge detector.



Clustering: Clustering algorithms can be used to group pixels in an image into different segments based on their colors or other features. K-means clustering is a popular method for image segmentation.



Region growing: This method involves starting with a seed point and then expanding the region to include neighboring pixels that are similar in some way, such as color or texture.



Image segmentation is used in a wide range of applications, including object recognition, medical image analysis, and autonomous vehicle navigation.",1
human_1108,"In computer graphics and computer vision, image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR) methods rely on a set of two-dimensional images of a scene to generate a three-dimensional model and then render some novel views of this scene.
The traditional approach of computer graphics has been used to create a geometric model in 3D and try to reproject it onto a two-dimensional image.  Computer vision, conversely, is mostly focused on detecting, grouping, and extracting features (edges, faces, etc.) present in a given picture and then trying to interpret them as three-dimensional clues.  Image-based modeling and rendering allows the use of multiple two-dimensional images in order to generate directly novel two-dimensional images, skipping the manual modeling stage.",0
ai_1109,"Image-based rendering (IBR) is a technique in computer graphics that involves generating and rendering a scene by using images, rather than geometric models and lighting calculations. This technique is used to create photorealistic images or animations that are difficult or impossible to generate with traditional rendering techniques.



There are several different approaches to IBR, but they all involve capturing images of a scene from different viewpoints or under different lighting conditions and using those images to synthesize a final image or animation. The captured images are often called ""textures"" or ""environment maps,"" and they can be used to represent the appearance of objects in the scene, the lighting and shading of the scene, or both.



One common approach to IBR is to use a set of panoramic images, also known as ""spherical harmonics,"" to represent the appearance and lighting of a scene. These images are captured by taking a series of photographs of the scene from a single point, with each photograph covering a different direction. The resulting images can then be combined to create a single, high-resolution panoramic image that represents the appearance of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. This image can be used to render the scene from any viewpoint within the field of view of the panoramic image.



Another approach to IBR is to use ""image-based lighting,"" which involves capturing the lighting of a scene using high dynamic range (HDR) images or light probes. These images can be used to synthesize the lighting of a scene from any viewpoint, allowing artists to create realistic lighting effects without having to calculate the lighting of the scene from scratch.



IBR has many applications in film, television, video games, and other areas where photorealistic images or animations are desired. It can be used to create convincing virtual environments, to generate realistic reflections and refractions, and to simulate complex lighting and shading effects.",1
human_1110,"Image stitching or photo stitching is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image. Commonly performed through the use of computer software, most approaches to image stitching require nearly exact overlaps between images and identical exposures to produce seamless results, although some stitching algorithms actually benefit from differently exposed images by doing high-dynamic-range imaging in regions of overlap. Some digital cameras can stitch their photos internally.",0
ai_1111,"Image stitching is a technique used to combine multiple images with overlapping fields of view into a single, larger image. This is often used in photography to create panoramic images or to extend the field of view in an image. It can also be used in other applications such as creating virtual tours or 360 degree images.



Image stitching involves aligning the overlapping images, adjusting for any differences in exposure or color, and blending the images together to create a seamless final image. This process can be done manually, using software tools such as Photoshop, or it can be automated using specialized image stitching software.



Image stitching requires careful alignment of the images to ensure that the final result looks natural and seamless. This can be challenging due to variations in perspective, lighting, and other factors that can affect the appearance of the images. However, with the right tools and techniques, it is possible to create high-quality stitched images that are virtually indistinguishable from a single, wide-angle photograph.",1
human_1112,"The light field is a vector function that describes the amount of light flowing in every direction through every point in space. The space of all possible light rays is given by the five-dimensional plenoptic function, and the magnitude of each ray is given by its radiance. Michael Faraday was the first to propose that light should be interpreted as a field, much like the magnetic fields on which he had been working. The phrase light field was coined by Andrey Gershun in a classic 1936 paper on the radiometric properties of light in three-dimensional space.
Modern approaches to light field display explore co-designs of optical elements and compressive computation to achieve higher resolutions, increased contrast, wider fields of view, and other benefits.
The term “radiance field” may also be used to refer to similar concepts. The term is used in modern research such as neural radiance fields.",0

It is a type of information that can be captured by a camera, and it can be used to create images that are more realistic and lifelike than those produced by traditional cameras.



There are several ways to capture a light field, including using specialized cameras that are equipped with multiple lenses or using software algorithms to analyze the light in a scene. Once the light field has been captured, it can be used to create images that have a greater sense of depth and dimensionality, as well as to produce images that can be viewed from different angles.



Light field technology is still relatively new, and it is being actively researched and developed in the field of computer graphics and computer vision. It has the potential to revolutionize the way that images are captured and displayed, and it could have a wide range of applications, including in virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing, and more.",1
human_1114,"In computer vision and image processing, a feature is a piece of information about the content of an image; typically about whether a certain region of the image has certain properties. Features may be specific structures in the image such as points, edges or objects. Features may also be the result of a general neighborhood operation or feature detection applied to the image. Other examples of features are related to motion in image sequences, or to shapes defined in terms of curves or boundaries between different image regions.
More broadly a feature is any piece of information which is relevant for solving the computational task related to a certain application. This is the same sense as feature in machine learning and pattern recognition generally, though image processing has a very sophisticated collection of features. The feature concept is very general and the choice of features in a particular computer vision system may be highly dependent on the specific problem at hand.",0
ai_1115,"In the field of computer vision, a feature is a piece of information or a characteristic that can be extracted from an image or video. Features can be used to describe the content of an image or video and are often used as input to machine learning algorithms for tasks such as object recognition, image classification, and object tracking.



There are many different types of features that can be extracted from images and videos, including:



Color features: These describe the color distribution and intensity of the pixels in an image.



Texture features: These describe the spatial arrangement of the pixels in an image, such as the smoothness or roughness of an object's surface.



Shape features: These describe the geometric properties of an object, such as its edges, corners, and overall contour.



Scale-invariant features: These are features that are not sensitive to changes in scale, such as the size or orientation of an object.



Invariant features: These are features that are invariant to certain transformations, such as rotation or translation.



In computer vision applications, the selection of features is an important factor in the performance of the machine learning algorithms that are used. Some features may be more useful for certain tasks than others, and choosing the right features can significantly improve the accuracy of the algorithm.",1

Solid-state physics is an important field of study in materials science, as it provides the underlying principles for understanding the behavior of materials and how they can be manipulated and engineered for specific applications. It is also closely related to other fields of physics, such as condensed matter physics, which deals with the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, and semiconductor physics, which deals with the properties of materials that can be used as electronic devices.",1
human_1118,"An image sensor or imager is a sensor that detects and conveys information used to make an image. It does so by converting the variable attenuation of light waves (as they pass through or reflect off objects) into signals, small bursts of current that convey the information. The waves can be light or other electromagnetic radiation. Image sensors are used in electronic imaging devices of both analog and digital types, which include digital cameras, camera modules, camera phones, optical mouse devices, medical imaging equipment, night vision equipment such as thermal imaging devices, radar, sonar, and others. As technology changes, electronic and digital imaging tends to replace chemical and analog imaging.
The two main types of electronic image sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) and the active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor). Both CCD and CMOS sensors are based on metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology, with CCDs based on MOS capacitors and CMOS sensors based on MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) amplifiers. Analog sensors for invisible radiation tend to involve vacuum tubes of various kinds, while digital sensors include flat-panel detectors.",0
ai_1119,"An image sensor is a device that converts an optical image into an electronic signal. It is an essential component of many types of electronic imaging systems, including digital cameras, camcorders, and scanners.



The image sensor consists of a grid of photodiodes, which are tiny semiconductor devices that convert light energy into electrical current. When light strikes a photodiode, it generates an electrical charge. The amount of charge that is generated is proportional to the intensity of the light, with higher intensity light generating more charge.



Each photodiode in the image sensor corresponds to a pixel in the final image. The image sensor converts the optical image into an electronic signal by measuring the amount of charge generated by each photodiode and translating that into a numerical value. This process is known as ""digitization.""



There are several different types of image sensors, including charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors. CCD sensors are typically used in high-end digital cameras, while CMOS sensors are more common in lower-end cameras and other consumer electronics.

human_1120,"In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of waves of the electromagnetic (EM) field, which propagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. All of these waves form part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.  Depending on the frequency of oscillation, different wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum are produced. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted c. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength.  Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter.  In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.
Electromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration, and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles, exerting force on them.  EM waves carry energy, momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact.  Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (""radiate"") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this language, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena.
In quantum mechanics, an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of photons, uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field, responsible for all electromagnetic interactions. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level. Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation. The energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by Planck's equation E = hf, where E is the energy per photon, f is the frequency of the photon, and h is Planck's constant. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.
The effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called non-ionizing radiation, because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules, or break chemical bonds. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ionizing radiation, since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. These radiations have the ability to cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard.",0

Electromagnetic radiation comes in many different forms, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of electromagnetic radiation has a different frequency and wavelength, and they are all characterized by the way in which they interact with matter and the ways in which they can be detected and measured.",1
human_1122,"Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).
In physics, the term ""light"" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization. Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s), is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.

human_1124,"Infrared (IR), sometimes called infrared light, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. It is therefore invisible to the human eye. IR is generally understood to encompass wavelengths from around 1 millimeter (300 GHz) to the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum, around 700 nanometers (430 THz).[verification needed] Longer IR wavelengths (30 μm-100 μm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation range. Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is at infrared wavelengths. As a form of electromagnetic radiation, IR propagates energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon.
It was long known that fires emit invisible heat; in 1681 the pioneering experimenter Edme Mariotte showed that glass, though transparent to sunlight, obstructed radiant heat. In 1800 the astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered that infrared radiation is a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer. Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel's studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth's climate.
Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.
Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, to detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect the overheating of electrical components.
Military and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm (micrometers). Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.",0

ai_1131,"The visual cortex is a part of the brain that processes visual information. It is located in the occipital lobe, which is located at the back of the brain. The visual cortex is responsible for interpreting the images that we see and constructing a coherent visual representation of the world around us.



The visual cortex is made up of several different areas, each of which is responsible for different aspects of visual processing. For example, some areas of the visual cortex are responsible for analyzing the basic features of an image, such as color, shape, and contrast. Other areas are responsible for integrating information from different parts of the visual field and constructing a 3-dimensional representation of the world.



The visual cortex receives input from the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye. When light enters the eye, it is detected by the retina and transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The visual cortex then processes this information and sends signals to other parts of the brain, allowing us to see and interpret the world around us.",1
human_1132,"Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment through photopic vision (daytime vision), color vision, scotopic vision (night vision), and mesopic vision (twilight vision), using light in the visible spectrum reflected by objects in the environment. This is different from visual acuity, which refers to how clearly a person sees (for example ""20/20 vision""). A person can have problems with visual perceptual processing even if they have 20/20 vision.
The resulting perception is also known as vision, sight, or eyesight (adjectives visual, optical, and ocular, respectively). The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and molecular biology, collectively referred to as vision science.",0
ai_1133,"Biological vision is the process by which organisms perceive and interpret visual stimuli using their visual system. It is a complex process that involves the eye, the brain, and various neural pathways that connect them.



The eye is a specialized organ that is responsible for capturing light and turning it into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. The retina, a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye, contains photoreceptors called rods and cones. Rods are sensitive to light and dark and are responsible for detecting basic shapes and movements. Cones are responsible for color vision and are most sensitive to light in the middle of the visible spectrum (yellow-green).



The electrical signals produced by the retina are transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. The brain then processes the signals to create a visual image. This process involves various neural pathways and brain regions, including the primary visual cortex and the visual association areas.

human_1148,"Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.
CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.
CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.
Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.
Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",0

human_1152,"An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or ""chip"") of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Large numbers of tiny MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) integrate into a small chip. This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to integrated circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones and other home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs such as modern computer processors and microcontrollers.
Very-large-scale integration was made practical by technological advancements in metal–oxide–silicon (MOS) semiconductor device fabrication. Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size – a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail. These advances, roughly following Moore's law, make the computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.
ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits: cost and performance. The cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost of designing them and fabricating the required photomasks. This high initial cost means ICs are only commercially viable when high production volumes are anticipated.",0

In addition to its scientific mission, Curiosity has also been used to test new technologies and systems that could be used on future Mars missions, such as its use of a sky crane landing system to gently lower the rover to the surface. Since its arrival on Mars, Curiosity has made many important discoveries, including evidence that the Gale crater was once a lake bed with water that could have supported microbial life.",1
ai_1162,"A structured-light 3D scanner is a device that uses a projected pattern of light to capture the shape and surface details of an object. It works by projecting a pattern of light onto the object and capturing images of the deformed pattern with a camera. The deformation of the pattern allows the scanner to determine the distance from the camera to each point on the surface of the object.



Structured-light 3D scanners are typically used in a variety of applications, including industrial inspection, reverse engineering, and quality control. They can be used to create highly accurate digital models of objects for use in design and manufacturing, as well as for visualization and analysis.



There are several different types of structured-light 3D scanners, including those that use sinusoidal patterns, binary patterns, and multi-frequency patterns. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which type to use depends on the specific application and the requirements of the measurement task.",1
human_1163,"A thermographic camera (also called an infrared camera or thermal imaging camera, thermal camera or thermal imager) is a device that creates an image using infrared (IR) radiation, similar to a normal camera that forms an image using visible light. Instead of the 400–700 nanometre (nm) range of the visible light camera, infrared cameras are sensitive to wavelengths from about 1,000 nm (1 micrometre or μm) to about 14,000 nm (14 μm). The practice of capturing and analyzing the data they provide is called thermography.",0
ai_1164,"A thermographic camera, also known as a thermal imaging camera, is a device that uses infrared technology to create a visual image of the heat patterns emitted by an object or area. These cameras can detect and measure the temperature of objects and surfaces without the need for physical contact. They are often used in a variety of applications, including building insulation inspections, electrical inspections, and medical imaging, as well as in military, law enforcement, and search and rescue operations.



Thermographic cameras work by detecting and measuring the infrared radiation, or heat, emitted by objects and surfaces. This radiation is invisible to the naked eye, but it can be detected by specialized sensors and converted into a visual image that shows the temperature of different objects and surfaces. The camera then displays this information as a heat map, with different colors indicating different temperatures.



Thermographic cameras are highly sensitive and can detect small differences in temperature, making them useful for a variety of applications. They are often used to detect and diagnose problems in electrical systems, identify energy loss in buildings, and detect overheating equipment. They can also be used to detect the presence of people or animals in low light or obscured visibility conditions, such as during search and rescue operations or military surveillance.



Thermographic cameras are also used in medical imaging, particularly in the detection of breast cancer. They can be used to create thermal images of the breast, which can help to identify abnormalities that may be indicative of cancer. In this application, thermographic cameras are used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools, such as mammography, to improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis.",1
human_1165,"Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. There are three general branches of spectral imagers. There are push broom scanners and the related whisk broom scanners (spatial scanning), which read images over time, band sequential scanners (spectral scanning), which acquire images of an area at different wavelengths, and snapshot hyperspectral imaging, which uses a staring array to generate an image in an instant.
Whereas the human eye sees color of visible light in mostly three bands (long wavelengths - perceived as red, medium wavelengths - perceived as green, and short wavelengths - perceived as blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging measures continuous spectral bands, as opposed to multiband imaging which measures spaced spectral bands.
Engineers build hyperspectral sensors and processing systems for applications in astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance. Hyperspectral sensors look at objects using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object. For example, a spectral signature for oil helps geologists find new oil fields.",0
ai_1166,"A hyperspectral imager is a type of remote sensing instrument that is used to measure the reflectance of a target object or scene across a wide range of wavelengths, typically in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These instruments are often mounted on satellites, aircraft, or other types of platforms and are used to produce images of the Earth's surface or other objects of interest.



The key characteristic of a hyperspectral imager is its ability to measure the reflectance of a target object across a wide range of wavelengths, typically with a high spectral resolution. This allows the instrument to identify and quantify the materials present in the scene based on their unique spectral signatures. For example, a hyperspectral imager can be used to detect and map the presence of minerals, vegetation, water, and other materials on the Earth's surface.



Hyperspectral imagers are used in a wide range of applications, including mineral exploration, agricultural monitoring, land use mapping, environmental monitoring, and military surveillance. They are often used to identify and classify objects and materials based on their spectral characteristics, and can provide detailed information about the composition and distribution of materials in a scene.",1
human_1167,"Imaging radar is an application of radar which is used to create two-dimensional images, typically of landscapes. Imaging radar provides its light to illuminate an area on the ground and take a picture at radio wavelengths. It uses an antenna and digital computer storage to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the energy that was reflected back towards the radar antenna. The radar moves along a flight path and the area illuminated by the radar, or footprint, is moved along the surface in a swath, building the image as it does so.
Digital radar images are composed of many dots.  Each pixel in the radar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground: brighter areas represent high backscatter, darker areas represents low backscatter.
The traditional application of radar is to display the position and motion of typically highly reflective objects (such as aircraft or ships) by sending out a radiowave signal, and then detecting the direction and delay of the reflected signal. Imaging radar on the other hand attempts to form an image of one object (e.g. a landscape) by furthermore registering the intensity of the reflected signal to determine the amount of scattering (cf. Light scattering). The registered electromagnetic scattering is then mapped onto a two-dimensional plane, with points with a higher reflectivity getting assigned usually a brighter color, thus creating an image.
Several techniques have evolved to do this. Generally they take advantage of the Doppler effect caused by the rotation or other motion of the object and by the changing view of the object brought about by the relative motion between the object and the back-scatter that is perceived by the radar of the object (typically, a plane) flying over the earth. Through recent improvements of the techniques, radar imaging is getting more accurate. Imaging radar has been used to map the Earth, other planets, asteroids, other celestial objects and to categorize targets for military systems.",0
ai_1168,"Radar imaging is a technique used to create images or maps of objects or surfaces using radar. Radar is a type of technology that uses radio waves to detect and track objects, measure distances, and determine speed. It operates by emitting a radio frequency (RF) signal and measuring the reflected energy that returns to the radar antenna.



In radar imaging, the radar antenna sends out a pulse of RF energy and measures the reflection of the pulse off the object or surface being imaged. The strength and timing of the reflection is used to determine the distance, size, and shape of the object. By repeating this process multiple times and collecting data from different angles, a radar system can create an image or map of the object or surface.



Radar imaging has a number of applications, including remote sensing, weather forecasting, aviation, and military surveillance. It is particularly useful for imaging objects or surfaces that are difficult to see or access, such as those that are buried underground, hidden behind buildings or vegetation, or located in remote or hazardous locations.",1
human_1169,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.
MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging and follow-up of disease. Compared to CT, MRI provides better contrast in images of soft-tissues, e.g. in the brain or abdomen. However, it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients, due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long, confining tube, though ""Open"" MRI designs mostly relieve this. Additionally, implants and other non-removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely.
MRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but ""nuclear"" was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce a RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.
Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects, such as mummies. Diffusion MRI and functional MRI extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis.[dubious  – discuss]",0
ai_1170,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the organs and tissues within the body. It is a non-invasive way to examine the body, and it does not use ionizing radiation, such as x-rays.



During an MRI scan, the patient is placed inside a large magnet and radio waves are used to excite the protons within the body's cells. As the protons return to their normal state, they emit a signal that is detected by the MRI machine and used to create detailed images of the inside of the body. These images can be viewed on a computer and can be used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, including injuries, diseases, and abnormalities.



MRI is a powerful tool for diagnosis and can provide detailed images of the brain, spine, joints, and other organs and tissues. It is often used to help diagnose problems with the nervous system, such as strokes and brain tumors, as well as problems with the musculoskeletal system, such as injuries and degenerative conditions.

ai_1171,"Side-scan sonar is a type of underwater imaging technology that uses sound waves to create a detailed, two-dimensional image of the seafloor. It works by emitting a series of pulses of sound energy, or sonar signals, from a transducer that is mounted on a boat or other platform. These signals are directed horizontally outward from the transducer, creating a fan-shaped beam that sweeps across the seafloor. As the sonar signals bounce off the seafloor and other underwater objects, they are reflected back to the transducer, which records the time delay between when the signal was emitted and when it was received. This information is used to create a detailed image of the seafloor and any objects on it.



Side-scan sonar is often used for a variety of applications, including mapping the seafloor, searching for shipwrecks, detecting underwater mines, and locating underwater pipelines and cables. It is also used for scientific research, including studying the geology of the seafloor and the distribution of marine life.",1
human_1172,"Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations.  The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In digital electronics, a digital signal is represented as a pulse train, which is typically generated by the switching of a transistor.
Digital signal processing and analog signal processing are subfields of signal processing. DSP applications include audio and speech processing, sonar, radar and other sensor array processing, spectral density estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, data compression, video coding, audio coding, image compression, signal processing for telecommunications, control systems, biomedical engineering, and seismology, among others.
DSP can involve linear or nonlinear operations. Nonlinear signal processing is closely related to nonlinear system identification and can be implemented in the time, frequency, and spatio-temporal domains.
The application of digital computation to signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as error detection and correction in transmission as well as data compression.

human_1183,"Natural language generation (NLG) is a software process that produces natural language output. In one of the most widely-cited survey of NLG methods, NLG is characterized as ""the subfield of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics that is concerned with the construction of computer systems than can produce understandable texts in English or other human languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information"".
While it is widely agreed that the output of any NLG process is text, there is some disagreement on whether the inputs of an NLG system need to be non-linguistic. Common applications of NLG methods include the production of various reports, for example weather  and patient reports; image captions; and chatbots.
Automated NLG can be compared to the process humans use when they turn ideas into writing or speech. Psycholinguists prefer the term language production for this process, which can also be described in mathematical terms, or modeled in a computer for psychological research. NLG systems can also be compared to translators of artificial computer languages, such as decompilers or transpilers, which also produce human-readable code generated from an intermediate representation. Human languages tend to be considerably more complex and allow for much more ambiguity and variety of expression than programming languages, which makes NLG more challenging.
NLG may be viewed as complementary to natural-language understanding (NLU): whereas in natural-language understanding, the system needs to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language, in NLG the system needs to make decisions about how to put a representation into words. The practical considerations in building NLU vs. NLG systems are not symmetrical. NLU needs to deal with ambiguous or erroneous user input, whereas the ideas the system wants to express through NLG are generally known precisely. NLG needs to choose a specific, self-consistent textual representation from many potential representations, whereas NLU generally tries to produce a single, normalized representation of the idea expressed.
NLG has existed since ELIZA was developed in the mid 1960s, but the methods were first used commercially in the 1990s. NLG techniques range from simple template-based systems like a mail merge that generates form letters, to systems that have a complex understanding of human grammar.

human_1185,"The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a ""mind,"" ""understanding"" or ""consciousness,""[a] regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, ""Minds, Brains, and Programs"", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle's argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.
The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.""[b]

They are also given a stack of Chinese characters and a series of requests written in Chinese. The person follows the rules to manipulate the Chinese characters and produces a series of responses in Chinese, which are then given to the person making the requests. From the perspective of the person making the requests, it appears that the person in the room understands Chinese, as they are able to produce appropriate responses to Chinese requests.



However, the person in the room does not actually understand Chinese - they are simply following a set of rules that allow them to manipulate Chinese characters in a way that appears to be understanding.

In transformational grammar, the basic structure of a sentence is represented by a deep structure, which reflects the underlying meaning of the sentence. This deep structure is then transformed into a surface structure, which is the actual form of the sentence as it is spoken or written. The transformation from deep structure to surface structure is accomplished through a set of rules known as transformational rules.



Transformational grammar is based on the idea that language is a formal system that is governed by a set of rules and principles, and that these rules and principles can be used to generate an infinite number of sentences. It is an important theoretical framework in linguistics, and has been influential in the development of other theories of grammar, such as generative grammar and minimalist grammar.",1
human_1189,"Corpus linguistics is the study of a language as that language is expressed in its text corpus (plural corpora), its body of ""real world"" text. Corpus linguistics proposes that a reliable analysis of a language is more feasible with corpora collected in the field—the natural context (""realia"") of that language—with minimal experimental interference.
The text-corpus method uses the body of texts written in any natural language to derive the set of abstract rules which govern that language. Those results can be used to explore the relationships between that subject language and other languages which have undergone a similar analysis. The first such corpora were manually derived from source texts, but now that work is automated.
Corpora have not only been used for linguistics research, they have also been used to compile dictionaries (starting with The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language in 1969) and grammar guides, such as A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language, published in 1985.

N-gram models predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous n-1 words, where n is a parameter of the model. RNNs and transformers, on the other hand, can consider the entire context of a sequence of words when making a prediction.",1

ai_1196,"A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that describes a sequence of observations that are generated by a system whose state is hidden from the observer. It is a type of Markov model, which is a mathematical model that represents a sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.



In an HMM, the sequence of observations is assumed to be generated by a sequence of underlying states, where the state of the system at any given time is not directly observable. Instead, the observations are generated by the system's state according to some probabilistic rules.



The HMM consists of a set of states, a set of observations, and a set of probabilities that define the likelihood of transitioning between states and the likelihood of observing a particular outcome given a particular state. The HMM can be used to predict the most likely sequence of hidden states that generated a given sequence of observations.



HMMs are widely used in various fields, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. They are particularly useful for modeling systems where the underlying states are not directly observable, but the observations are generated according to some probabilistic rules.",1
ai_1197,"Neural machine translation is a type of machine translation that uses artificial neural networks to translate text from one language to another. This approach to machine translation has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the advances in natural language processing and the availability of large amounts of data and computing power.



In neural machine translation, the translation process is modeled as a sequence-to-sequence task, where the input is a source language sentence and the output is the corresponding translation in the target language. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of translated sentences, and it learns to generate translations by predicting the next word in the target language based on the context of the source language sentence and the previously generated words in the target language.



One of the key advantages of neural machine translation is that it can handle long and complex sentences and handle multiple languages at the same time. It is also able to handle idiomatic expressions and language-specific nuances, making the translations more fluent and natural-sounding. However, it requires a large amount of labeled data to train on, and the quality of the translations can depend on the quality and diversity of the training data.",1

The system uses this dataset to learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases in the source and target languages.



Once the statistical model has been trained, it can be used to translate new texts by analyzing the probability of different translations for each word or phrase in the source text, and choosing the most likely translation based on the statistical model.

human_1202,"Data and information visualization (data viz or info viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or information is numerous as for example a time series.
It is also the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. It is related to infographics and scientific visualization. One distinction is that it's information visualization when the spatial representation (e.g., the page layout of a graphic design) is chosen, whereas it's scientific visualization when the spatial representation is given.
From an academic point of view, this representation can be considered as a mapping between the original data (usually numerical) and graphic elements (for example, lines or points in a chart). The mapping determines how the attributes of these elements vary according to the data. In this light, a bar chart is a mapping of the length of a bar to a magnitude of a variable. Since the graphic design of the mapping can adversely affect the readability of a chart, mapping is a core competency of Data visualization.
Data and information visualization has its roots in the field of statistics and is therefore generally considered a branch of descriptive statistics. However, because both design skills and statistical and computing skills are required to visualize effectively, it is argued by authors such as Gershon and Page that it is both an art and a science.
Research into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information.",0

human_1204,"In computer science, an online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start.
In contrast, an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand. In operations research, the area in which online algorithms are developed is called online optimization.
As an example, consider the sorting algorithms selection sort and insertion sort: selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder and places it at the front, which requires access to the entire input; it is thus an offline algorithm. On the other hand, insertion sort considers one input element per iteration and produces a partial solution without considering future elements. Thus insertion sort is an online algorithm.
Note that the final result of an insertion sort is optimum, i.e., a correctly sorted list. For many problems, online algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms. If the ratio between the performance of an online algorithm and an optimal offline algorithm is bounded, the online algorithm is called competitive.
Not every offline algorithm has an efficient online counterpart.",0

For example, an online algorithm might be used to process a stream of data from a sensor, or to process user input in a web application.



Online algorithms often have to make trade-offs between the speed at which they process the input data and the quality of the output they produce. In many cases, the output produced by an online algorithm may not be as accurate as the output produced by an offline algorithm, but the ability to process the input data in a streaming fashion can be more important in certain scenarios.

human_1207,"Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents and other electronically represented sources. In most of the cases this activity concerns processing human language texts by means of natural language processing (NLP). Recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images/audio/video/documents could be seen as information extraction

from an online news sentence such as:
A broad goal of IE is to allow computation to be done on the previously unstructured data.  A more specific goal is to allow logical reasoning to draw inferences based on the logical content of the input data.  Structured data is semantically well-defined data from a chosen target domain, interpreted with respect to category and context.
Information extraction is the part of a greater puzzle which deals with the problem of devising automatic methods for text management, beyond its transmission, storage and display. The discipline of information retrieval (IR) has developed automatic methods, typically of a statistical flavor, for indexing large document collections and classifying documents. Another complementary approach is that of natural language processing (NLP) which has solved the problem of modelling human language processing with considerable success when taking into account the magnitude of the task. In terms of both difficulty and emphasis,  IE deals with tasks in between both IR and NLP. In terms of input, IE assumes the existence of a set of documents in which each document follows a template, i.e. describes one or more entities or events  in a manner that is similar to those in other documents but differing in the details. An example, consider a group of newswire articles on Latin American terrorism with each article presumed to be based upon one or more terroristic acts. We also define for any given IE task a template, which is a(or a set of) case frame(s) to hold the information contained in a single document. For the terrorism example, a template would have slots corresponding to the perpetrator, victim, and weapon of the terroristic act, and the date on which the event happened. An IE system for this problem is required to “understand” an attack article only enough to find data corresponding to the slots in this template.",0

To identify association rules, data mining algorithms typically use a measure of the strength of the association between the items in the ""if"" and ""then"" parts of the rule. This measure is called support, and it reflects the number of transactions in the dataset in which the items co-occur. A rule with high support is considered to be more reliable, because it occurs more frequently in the data.

Sequential pattern mining has a wide range of applications, including market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. It can be used to understand customer behavior, predict future events, and identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent in the data.",1
human_1223,"A spatial database is a general-purpose database (usually a relational database) that has been enhanced to include spatial data that represents objects defined in a geometric space, along with tools for querying and analyzing such data.  Most spatial databases allow the representation of simple geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons. Some spatial databases handle more complex structures such as 3D objects, topological coverages, linear networks, and triangulated irregular networks (TINs). While typical databases have developed to manage various numeric and character types of data, such databases require additional functionality to process spatial data types efficiently, and developers have often added geometry or feature data types. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) developed the Simple Features specification (first released in 1997) and sets standards for adding spatial functionality to database systems. The SQL/MM Spatial ISO/IEC standard is a part the SQL/MM multimedia standard and extends the Simple Features standard with data types that support circular interpolations.",0
ai_1224,"A spatial index is a data structure that is used to efficiently store and query data that represents objects defined in a geometric space. It is designed to support spatial queries, which are queries that return data based on the spatial relationships between objects. For example, a spatial index could be used to quickly find all objects within a certain distance of a given point, or to find the nearest object to a given point.



Spatial indexes are commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) and other applications that deal with spatial data. They can be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as quadtrees, R-trees, and k-d trees. The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the type and size of the data, the types of spatial queries that will be performed, and the desired level of performance.



Spatial indexes can significantly improve the performance of spatial queries by reducing the number of objects that need to be examined. For example, if a spatial index is used to store a large dataset of points, a query to find all points within a certain distance of a given point can be satisfied by examining only a small subset of the points, rather than the entire dataset. This can greatly reduce the time and resources required to perform the query.",1
human_1225,"Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging attractive to buyers; defining the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.
It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers approach the planning stage of marketing.
The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research,[10] and the characteristics of the product's target market.[11] Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements.[12]

This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.
The process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searching—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.
Conventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis).  This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone.

ai_1230,"Data snooping, also known as data mining or overfitting, is a statistical practice in which a model is fitted to a dataset using a technique that is too flexible or overly complex for the size of the dataset. This can lead to the model fitting the noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship, resulting in poor generalization to new data.



Data snooping can occur when a model is trained on a dataset that is too small or when the model is allowed to have too many parameters relative to the amount of data it is being trained on. As a result, the model may learn patterns that are specific to the training data and do not generalize well to new data. This can lead to poor performance on tasks such as prediction or classification when the model is applied to new data.



To avoid data snooping, it is important to use appropriate model selection techniques, such as cross-validation, to ensure that the chosen model is not overly complex or flexible relative to the size of the dataset.

With a 2020 population of 1,386,932,[11] it is the eighth most populous city in the United States and the seat of San Diego County, the fifth most populous county in the United States, with 3,338,330 estimated residents as of 2019. The city is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center. San Diego is the second largest city in the state of California, after Los Angeles.
Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego is frequently referred to as the ""Birthplace of California"", as it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the U.S. west coast.[12] Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California became part of the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexican–American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.
San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, research, and manufacturing. The city is the economic center of the San Diego–Tijuana conurbation, the second most populous transborder metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere (after Detroit–Windsor), home to an estimated 4,922,723 people as of 2012.[13] The primary border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, the San Ysidro Port of Entry, is the busiest international land border crossing in the world outside of Asia (fourth-busiest overall).

human_1242,"In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule), named after Thomas Bayes, describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately (by conditioning it on their age) than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.
One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different probability interpretations. With Bayesian probability interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to Bayesian statistics, being considered ""to the theory of probability what Pythagoras's theorem is to geometry.""",0

where:



P(H|E) is the probability of hypothesis H being true given the evidence E. This is the probability that we want to calculate.



P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E occurring given that the hypothesis H is true.



P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H being true. This is the probability of the hypothesis before any evidence is taken into account.



P(E) is the probability of the evidence E occurring, regardless of the hypothesis.



Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis being true given the evidence that we have observed. It is a way of revising our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis as we acquire new evidence.

human_1246,"In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
When data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed]",0
ai_1247,"Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The goal of an SVM is to find the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the different classes.



In the case of classification, the SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that maximally separates the different classes. The distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data point on each side is known as the margin. The goal is to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin, as this maximizes the separation between the classes. Data points that lie on the margin are known as support vectors.



SVMs can be used to solve both linear and nonlinear classification problems. In the case of linear classification, the SVM algorithm finds a linear hyperplane to separate the classes. For nonlinear classification, the algorithm uses a kernel function to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, where it can find a hyperplane to separate the classes.



SVMs have several advantages, including their ability to handle high-dimensional data and their effectiveness in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. They are also relatively robust to overfitting, as they use a regularization parameter to control the complexity of the model.



However, SVMs can be sensitive to the selection of kernel function and hyperparameters, and they may not scale well to very large datasets.",1

human_1250,"A data mart is a structure/access pattern specific to data warehouse environments, used to retrieve client-facing data. The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team. Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart including all the hardware, software and data.  This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit owner will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.
Warehouses and data marts are built because the information in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible. This organization requires queries that are too complicated, difficult to access or resource intensive.
While transactional databases are designed to be updated, data warehouses or marts are read only. Data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records. Data marts improve end-user response time by allowing users to have access to the specific type of data they need to view most often, by providing the data in a way that supports the collective view of a group of users.

human_1255,"In statistics, missing data, or missing values, occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation.  Missing data are a common occurrence and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
Missing data can occur because of nonresponse: no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit (""subject""). Some items are more likely to generate a nonresponse than others: for example items about private subjects such as income. Attrition is a type of missingness that can occur in longitudinal studies—for instance studying development where a measurement is repeated after a certain period of time. Missingness occurs when participants drop out before the test ends and one or more measurements are missing.
Data often are missing in research in economics, sociology, and political science because governments or private entities choose not to, or fail to, report critical statistics, or because the information is not available. Sometimes missing values are caused by the researcher—for example, when data collection is done improperly or mistakes are made in data entry.
These forms of missingness take different types, with different impacts on the validity of conclusions from research: Missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random.  Missing data can be handled similarly as censored data.",0
ai_1256,"In statistical analysis, missing data refers to data that is not available or is incomplete in a dataset. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as incomplete record-keeping, data that was not collected, or data that was lost or corrupted. Missing data can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses and can lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly addressed.



There are different ways to handle missing data, depending on the nature of the data, the reason for the missing values, and the goals of the analysis. Some common approaches include:



Deletion: This involves simply removing records with missing values from the dataset. This is often the simplest approach, but it can also lead to a loss of statistical power and can result in biased estimates if the missing data are not missing at random.



Imputation: This involves estimating the missing values using statistical techniques such as mean imputation, median imputation, or multiple imputation. While imputation can help to preserve the sample size and reduce bias, it can also introduce errors and uncertainty into the analysis.



Weighting: This involves adjusting the weights of the observations in the analysis to account for the missing data. This can be effective in reducing bias, but it can also be complex and may not be feasible in all cases.



It is important to carefully consider how to handle missing data in order to ensure the reliability and validity of statistical analyses.",1
ai_1257,"Statistical hypothesis testing is a method for testing a claim or hypothesis about a population based on a sample of data drawn from that population. It is used to evaluate whether the claim is supported by the data or whether the data provide sufficient evidence to reject the claim.



In statistical hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis, which is a statement that there is no relationship between two variables or no difference between two groups. For example, the null hypothesis might be that there is no difference in the average income of men and women in a particular population.



We then collect data from a sample of the population and use statistical techniques to determine whether the data provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If the data do not provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, we say that the null hypothesis is not rejected and that we do not have enough evidence to support the claim. If the data provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, we say that the null hypothesis is rejected and that the data support the claim.



There are several types of statistical tests that can be used for hypothesis testing, including t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests, among others. The choice of which test to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific hypotheses being tested.",1
human_1258,"An academic journal or scholarly journal is a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny, and discussion of research. They nearly-universally require peer-review or other scrutiny  from contemporaries competent and established in their respective fields. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, or book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal, according to Henry Oldenburg (the first editor of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society), is to give researchers a venue to ""impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences.""
The term academic journal applies to scholarly publications in all fields; this article discusses the aspects common to all academic field journals. Scientific journals and journals of the quantitative social sciences vary in form and function from journals of the humanities and qualitative social sciences; their specific aspects are separately discussed.
The first academic journal was Journal des sçavans (January 1665), followed soon after by Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (March 1665), and Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences (1666). The first fully peer-reviewed journal was Medical Essays and Observations (1733).",0

ai_1261,"Subspace clustering is a machine learning technique that is used to identify clusters within a dataset where each cluster is defined by a subset of the features, rather than all of the features. This means that the clusters can be found in lower-dimensional subspaces of the full feature space.



Subspace clustering is useful when the data exhibits some structure that can be described by a combination of a small number of features, rather than all of the features. For example, if a dataset contains information about customers, the features may include age, income, location, and purchasing habits. Subspace clustering could be used to identify clusters of customers who share similar purchasing habits, even if they differ in other features such as age or income.



There are several algorithms that can be used for subspace clustering, including spectral clustering, iterative search methods, and probabilistic models. These algorithms generally involve finding a low-dimensional representation of the data and then applying clustering techniques to identify the clusters in the lower-dimensional space.



Subspace clustering is often used in applications such as image and video analysis, text mining, and bioinformatics, where the data may have structure that can be captured by a subset of the features.",1

The goal of UBA is to understand how users interact with the system and to identify patterns in their behavior that can be used to improve the user experience and optimize system performance.



UBA is commonly used in a variety of settings, including online platforms, websites, and software applications. It can be used to track user activity, such as clicks, page views, and time spent on specific pages, as well as more complex behaviors, such as the sequence of actions taken by a user or the completion of specific tasks.



UBA can be used to identify trends and patterns in user behavior that can help organizations make informed decisions about how to optimize their products and services. For example, UBA can be used to identify areas of a website or application that are frequently used or ignored, which can help organizations make design and content changes to improve the overall user experience.



Overall, UBA is an important tool for understanding and improving the way that users interact with systems and applications, and it can help organizations better understand and serve the needs of their customers.",1

human_1267,"Total Information Awareness (TIA) was a mass detection program by the United States Information Awareness Office. It operated under this title from February to May 2003 before being renamed Terrorism Information Awareness.
Based on the concept of predictive policing, TIA was meant to correlate detailed information about people in order to anticipate and prevent terrorist incidents before execution. The program modeled specific information sets in the hunt for terrorists around the globe. Admiral John Poindexter called it a ""Manhattan Project for counter-terrorism"". According to Senator Ron Wyden, TIA was the ""biggest surveillance program in the history of the United States"".
Congress defunded the Information Awareness Office in late 2003 after media reports criticized the government for attempting to establish ""Total Information Awareness"" over all citizens.
Although the program was formally suspended, other government agencies later adopted some of its software with only superficial changes. TIA's core architecture continued development under the code name ""Basketball."" According to a 2012 New York Times article, TIA's legacy was ""quietly thriving"" at the National Security Agency (NSA).[10]",0

The program was established in 2002 in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, with the goal of developing technologies to detect and prevent future terrorist attacks by collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data from a variety of sources.



The TIA program focused on developing technologies for analyzing and mining data from sources such as the internet, financial transactions, and electronic communications in order to identify patterns and trends that might indicate the planning of a terrorist attack. The program also sought to develop technologies for ""information fusion,"" or the integration and analysis of data from multiple sources.



The TIA program was controversial, as it raised concerns about privacy and civil liberties. Critics argued that the program could be used to collect and analyze data on ordinary citizens, potentially leading to the abuse of power and the erosion of privacy. In response to these concerns, Congress defunded the TIA program in 2003 and it was eventually shut down.",1

Common aggregate functions include:
Others include:
Formally, an aggregate function takes as input a set, a multiset (bag), or a list from some input domain I and outputs an element of an output domain O. The input and output domains may be the same, such as for SUM, or may be different, such as for COUNT.
Aggregate functions occur commonly in numerous programming languages, in spreadsheets, and in relational algebra.
The listagg function, as defined in the SQL:2016 standard

ai_1272,"In database management, an aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value. Aggregate functions are often used in database queries to perform operations such as calculating the average, minimum, maximum, or sum of a set of values.



For example, the SUM function calculates the sum of a set of values. You might use the SUM function in a query to find the total salary of all employees in a company, or the total sales of a particular product.



Other common aggregate functions include AVG (average), MIN (minimum value), and MAX (maximum value).



Here is an example of how you might use an aggregate function in a SQL query:



Copy code

SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;

This query would return the total salary of all employees in the employees table.



It's important to note that aggregate functions only work on sets of values, not individual values. So if you tried to use an aggregate function on a single value, you would get an error. For example, the following query would be invalid:



Copy code

SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

This is because the WHERE clause in the query is limiting the result set to a single row, and the SUM function can only be applied to a set of values, not a single value. To get the salary of a single employee, you would need to use a different type of function or omit the SUM function entirely.",1

For example, data can be aggregated by summing up values, averaging them, counting the number of occurrences, or finding the maximum or minimum value. Data can also be aggregated by grouping it according to certain criteria, such as location, time period, or category.



Data aggregation is a common practice in many fields, including business, finance, marketing, and scientific research. It can be done manually or using specialized software or tools.

The goal of data anonymization is to protect the privacy of individuals while still allowing their data to be used for legitimate purposes.



There are several techniques that can be used to anonymize data, including:



Pseudonymization: This involves replacing identifying information, such as a person's name or address, with a pseudonym or fake name. This can make it more difficult to link the data back to an individual, but the data may still be identifiable if combined with other data sources.



Aggregation: This involves grouping data together and only presenting summary statistics, rather than individual records. For example, rather than presenting data on the number of people living in each household, data could be presented on the average number of people living in households within a certain area.



Masking: This involves obscuring or hiding certain parts of the data, such as the last four digits of a person's social security number.



Noise injection: This involves adding random noise or perturbations to the data to make it more difficult to identify specific individuals.



Data anonymization is an important tool for protecting the privacy of individuals, particularly when data is being shared or used for research purposes. However, it is important to note that it is not always possible to completely anonymize data, and there is always some risk that the data could be re-identified.",1
human_1275,"Personal data, also known as personal information or personally identifiable information (PII), is any information related to an identifiable person.
The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the United States, but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on personal or personally, and identifiable or identifying. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. [a] Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the term ""personal data"" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.
National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-122 defines personally identifiable information as ""any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."" For instance, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII.
Personal data is defined under the GDPR as ""any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person"". The IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classes as personal data.
The concept of PII has become prevalent as information technology and the Internet have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website privacy policies specifically address the gathering of PII, and lawmakers such as the European Parliament have enacted a series of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.[10]
Important confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII identifies them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as HIPAA, PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non-prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, ""PII"" is typically deprecated internationally.",0
ai_1276,"Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual. This can include things like a person's name, address, phone number, email address, social security number, or other unique identifiers. PII is often collected and used by organizations for various purposes, such as to verify a person's identity, to contact them, or to keep records of their activities.



There are laws and regulations in place that govern the collection, use, and protection of PII. These laws vary by jurisdiction, but they generally require organizations to handle PII in a secure and responsible manner. For example, they may be required to obtain consent before collecting PII, to keep it secure and confidential, and to delete it when it is no longer needed.



In general, it is important to be careful about sharing personal information online or with organizations, as it can be used to track your activities, steal your identity, or otherwise compromise your privacy. It is a good idea to be aware of what information you are sharing and to take steps to protect your personal data.",1

Some current debates around the right to privacy include whether privacy can co-exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyze many details of an individual's life; whether or not the right to privacy is forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats; and whether threats of terrorism are a valid excuse to spy on the general population. Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacy – particularly technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo that use and collect personal data.

human_1279,"Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American and naturalized Russian former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy.
In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved, and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, The Washington Post, and other publications. Snowden also made extensive allegations against the GCSB, blowing the whistle of their domestic surveillance of New Zealanders and acts of espionage under John Key's government.
On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of State revoked his passport. Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia. In September 2022, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin,[10] and on 2 December 2022 he swore the oath of allegiance.[11]
A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a traitor,[12] a hero,[13] a whistleblower,[14] a dissident,[15] a coward,[16] and a patriot.[17] U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done ""grave damage"" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.[18] Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort ""to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.""[19] His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy, something that he has said he intended to do in retrospective interviews.[20]
In early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco–based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.[21] He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company.[22] In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills. ""I have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night,"" he told an Israeli audience in November 2018, ""but I live on the internet and every other city in the world.""[23] On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published.[24] On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v.

The reports mostly emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which he obtained whilst working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States. In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive ""Five Eyes"" network. In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times (United States), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), L'espresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El País (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden).
These media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Federal Intelligence Service (German: Bundesnachrichtendienst; BND) transfers ""massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA"", while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSE), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), Singapore (SID) as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA.[10][11][12][13][14][15]
On June 14, 2013, United States prosecutors charged Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. In late July 2013, he was granted a one-year temporary asylum by the Russian government,[16] contributing to a deterioration of Russia–United States relations.[17][18] Towards the end of October 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron warned The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice.[19] In November 2013, a criminal investigation of the disclosure was being undertaken by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service.[20] In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: ""We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we've seen.""[21]
The extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that ""the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light""[22] and critics such as Sean Wilentz have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance.[23] The US & British Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, the Pentagon concluded that Snowden committed the biggest ""theft"" of U.S. secrets in the history of the United States.[24] Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, described Snowden's disclosure as the ""most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever"".[25]",0

The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 establishes that there be 435 representatives and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the Congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states.
Article One of the U.S. Constitution requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old (House) or at least 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the U.S. for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent. Members in both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times.
The Congress was created by the U.S. Constitution and first met in 1789, replacing the Congress of the Confederation in its legislative function. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with one of the two major parties, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, and only rarely with a third party or independents affiliated with no party. In the case of the latter, the lack of affiliation with a political party does not mean that such members are unable to caucus with members of the political parties. Members can also switch parties at any time, although this is quite uncommon.",0

They can also be used to control the access and security of the database, and to specify the behavior of the DBMS when executing queries or transactions.



Database directives are usually written in a specialized language called a database query language, which is designed specifically for interacting with databases. Some examples of database query languages include Structured Query Language (SQL), which is commonly used with relational databases, and NoSQL, which is used with non-relational databases.

human_1287,"Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.
The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.
The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.
The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]
The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.",0

human_1289,"Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The best-known types are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term ""intellectual property"" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems.
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.[10]
The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is ""indivisible"", since an unlimited number of people can ""consume"" an intellectual good without its being depleted.[11][page needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.[12]",0

human_1295,"Open access (OA) is a set of principles and a range of practices through which research outputs are distributed online, free of access charges or other barriers. With open access strictly defined (according to the 2001 definition), or libre open access, barriers to copying or reuse are also reduced or removed by applying an open license for copyright.
The main focus of the open access movement is ""peer reviewed research literature"". Historically, this has centered mainly on print-based academic journals. Whereas non-open access journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges, open-access journals are characterised by funding models which do not require the reader to pay to read the journal's contents, relying instead on author fees or on public funding, subsidies and sponsorships. Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, monographs, research reports and images.
Since the revenue of most open access journals is earned from publication fees charged to the authors, OA publishers are motivated to increase their profits by accepting low-quality papers and by not performing thorough peer review. On the other hand, the prices for OA publications in the most prestigious journals have exceeded 5,000 US$, making such publishing model unaffordable to a large number of researchers. This increase in publishing cost has been called the ""Open-Access Sequel to [the] Serials Crisis"".",0

human_1297,"Fair use is a doctrine in United States law that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. Fair use is one of the limitations to copyright intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement. Unlike ""fair dealing"" rights that exist in most countries with a British legal history, the fair use right is a general exception that applies to all different kinds of uses with all types of works and turns on a flexible proportionality test that examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work.
The doctrine of ""fair use"" originated in the Anglo-American common law during the 18th and 19th centuries as a way of preventing copyright law from being too rigidly applied and ""stifling the very creativity which [copyright] law is designed to foster."" Though originally a common law doctrine, it was enshrined in statutory law when the U.S. Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976. The U.S. Supreme Court has issued several major decisions clarifying and reaffirming the fair use doctrine since the 1980s, most recently in the 2021 decision Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.",0

It is intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works.



The purpose of fair use is to allow people to use copyrighted material in a way that does not negatively impact the market for the original work. This means that if someone uses a copyrighted work in a way that is not likely to compete with the original work or substitute for it, then it is likely to be considered fair use.



There are four factors that are considered in determining whether a particular use of copyrighted material is fair:



The purpose and character of the use: Is the use being made for a non-commercial, educational, or transformative purpose, or is it being used for commercial gain? Uses that are more likely to be considered fair include criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.



The nature of the copyrighted work: Is the work being used primarily for informational or creative purposes? Informational works, such as news articles or reference materials, are more likely to be considered fair use than creative works, such as novels or movies.



The amount and substantiality of the portion used: How much of the work is being used, and is the portion used a significant or essential part of the work? Using a small amount of a work or using only a small portion of the work is more likely to be considered fair use.



The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work: Is the use likely to harm the market for or value of the original work? If the use is not likely to negatively impact the market for the original work, it is more likely to be considered fair use.



It is important to note that fair use is a defense to a claim of copyright infringement, and whether a particular use is fair use will depend on the specific circumstances of each case. It is always best to get permission from the copyright holder before using copyrighted material.",1

human_1301,"Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of mind, or, as narrow AI, is focused on one narrow task. In John Searle's terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”. Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems.  As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do.  Strong artificial intelligence systems are learning how to run independently of the programmers who programmed them. Weak AI is not able to have a mind of its own, and can only imitate physical behaviors that it can observe. 
It is contrasted with Strong AI, which is defined variously as: 
Scholars like Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak-AI hypothesis (that should not be confused with the ""general"" vs ""narrow"" AI distinction) and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill-posed and problematic since ""artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling""  (p. 85) (as, on the other hand, implied by the strong AI assumption).
AI can be classified as being “… limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.”  Narrow means the robot or computer is strictly limited to only being able to solve one problem at a time. Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

human_1303,"The expression computational intelligence (CI) usually refers to the ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation. Even though it is commonly considered a synonym of soft computing, there is still no commonly accepted definition of computational intelligence.
Generally, computational intelligence is a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real-world problems to which mathematical or traditional modelling can be useless for a few reasons: the processes might be too complex for mathematical reasoning, it might contain some uncertainties during the process, or the process might simply be stochastic in nature.[page needed] Indeed, many real-life problems cannot be translated into binary language (unique values of 0 and 1) for computers to process it. Computational Intelligence therefore provides solutions for such problems.
The methods used are close to the human's way of reasoning, i.e. it uses inexact and incomplete knowledge, and it is able to produce control actions in an adaptive way. CI therefore uses a combination of five main complementary techniques. The fuzzy logic which enables the computer to understand natural language,[page needed] artificial neural networks which permits the system to learn experiential data by operating like the biological one, evolutionary computing, which is based on the process of natural selection, learning theory, and probabilistic methods which helps dealing with uncertainty imprecision.
Except those main principles, currently popular approaches include biologically inspired algorithms such as swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems, which can be seen as a part of evolutionary computation, image processing, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, which tends to be confused with Computational Intelligence. But although both Computational Intelligence (CI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) seek similar goals, there's a clear distinction between them[according to whom?][citation needed].
Computational Intelligence is thus a way of performing like human beings[citation needed]. Indeed, the characteristic of ""intelligence"" is usually attributed[by whom?] to humans. More recently, many products and items also claim to be ""intelligent"", an attribute which is directly linked to the reasoning and decision making[further explanation needed].",0

human_1305,"Self-determination theory (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation and personality that concerns people's innate growth tendencies and innate psychological needs. It pertains to the motivation behind people's choices in the absence of external influences and distractions. SDT focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.
In the 1970s, research on SDT evolved from studies comparing intrinsic and extrinsic motives, and from growing understanding of the dominant role that intrinsic motivation played in individual behavior. It was not until the mid-1980s Edward L. Deci and Richard Ryan wrote a book titled ""Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation in Human Behavior"" that SDT was formally introduced and accepted as a sound empirical theory. Since the 2000s, research into practical applications of SDT has increased significantly.
The key research that led to the emergence of SDT included research on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity because it is interesting and satisfying in itself to do so, as opposed to doing an activity for the purpose of obtaining an external goal (extrinsic motivation). A taxonomy of motivations has been described based on the degree to which they are internalized. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external.
Edward Deci and Richard Ryan later expanded on the early work differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and proposed three main intrinsic needs involved in self-determination.[10] According to Deci and Ryan, three basic psychological needs motivate self-initiated behavior and specify essential nutrients for individual psychological health and well-being. These needs are said to be the universal and innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.",0
ai_1306,"Self-determination theory (SDT) is a theory of human motivation and personality that explains how people's basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are related to their well-being and psychological health.

According to SDT, people have three basic psychological needs:



Autonomy: the need to feel in control of one's own life and to make choices that are consistent with one's values and goals.



Competence: the need to feel effective and capable in one's endeavors.



Relatedness: the need to feel connected and supported by others.



SDT proposes that when these basic psychological needs are satisfied, people are more likely to experience positive emotions, well-being, and good mental health. On the other hand, when these needs are not met, people are more likely to experience negative emotions, poor well-being, and mental health problems.

Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem.
Aristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and humans: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only humans and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to humans only. In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level. For Aristotle, the first two souls, based on the body, perish when the living organism dies, whereas remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind. For Plato, however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body. It has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers, since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body, and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenon.
Dualism is closely associated with the thought of René Descartes (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence. Hence, he was the first documented Western philosopher to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today. Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.",0
ai_1312,"Mind–body dualism is a philosophical position that holds that the mind and the body are two distinct and separate entities. According to this view, the mind is an immaterial substance that is not subject to the same physical laws as the body. It is sometimes referred to as Cartesian dualism, after the French philosopher René Descartes, who is credited with its development.



Descartes argued that the mind is a non-physical substance that is capable of thinking, feeling, and perceiving, while the body is a physical substance that is subject to the laws of physics. He believed that the mind and the body interact with each other, but that they are fundamentally distinct.



There are several different versions of mind–body dualism, and philosophers continue to debate the plausibility of this view. Some argue that it is necessary to posit the existence of an immaterial mind in order to account for the subjective experiences of consciousness, while others argue that it is more parsimonious to posit that the mind is a product of the physical brain and its functions.",1

human_1315,"Human-based computation (HBC), human-assisted computation, ubiquitous human computing or distributed thinking (by analogy to distributed computing) is a computer science technique in which a machine performs its function by outsourcing certain steps to humans, usually as microwork. This approach uses differences in abilities and alternative costs between humans and computer agents to achieve symbiotic human–computer interaction. For computationally difficult tasks such as image recognition, human-based computation plays a central role in training Deep Learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems. In this case, human-based computation has been referred to as human-aided artificial intelligence.
In traditional computation, a human employs a computer to solve a problem; a human provides a formalized problem description and an algorithm to a computer, and receives a solution to interpret. Human-based computation frequently reverses the roles; the computer asks a person or a large group of people to solve a problem, then collects, interprets, and integrates their solutions. This turns hybrid networks of humans and computers into ""large scale distributed computing networks"". where code is partially executed in human brains and on silicon based processors.",0
ai_1316,"Human computation is a field of study that focuses on the design of systems that combine the strengths of humans and computers to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for either to solve individually. These systems often rely on the collective intelligence and diverse skills of large numbers of people, who work together to solve problems or perform tasks that are too complex or time-consuming for a single person or a computer to complete.



Examples of human computation include crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, which allow companies to outsource small tasks or jobs to a large, distributed workforce. Other examples include online games or other interactive systems that rely on human players to solve problems or perform tasks, such as finding solutions to puzzles, identifying objects in images, or transcribing speech or text.



Human computation can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including tasks related to data analysis, natural language processing, image or video recognition, and other areas where human judgment or intuition is valuable. It can also be used to facilitate collaboration and communication among large groups of people, or to harness the collective knowledge and expertise of a community to solve problems or make decisions.",1

It includes measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and other forms of cybercrime. It also involves measures to protect against unauthorized physical access to computer systems and data centers.



Effective computer security requires a combination of technical measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption, as well as non-technical measures, such as user awareness training, security policies, and incident response plans. It is an ongoing process that involves regularly reviewing, updating, and testing security measures to ensure that they remain effective in protecting against evolving threats.",1
human_1319,"In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.
A brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner).  Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.
When password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones.
Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.
Brute-force attacks are an application of brute-force search, the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one. The word 'hammering' is sometimes used to describe a brute-force attack, with 'anti-hammering' for countermeasures.",0
ai_1320,"A brute-force attack is a type of cybersecurity attack in which an attacker tries to guess a password or key by trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. This type of attack is often used to crack password-protected systems or to decrypt encrypted data.



In a brute-force attack, the attacker uses a program or script to automatically generate and try many different combinations of characters in order to guess the correct password or key. This can be done by using a list of commonly used passwords or by trying every possible combination of characters.



Brute-force attacks are often time-consuming and may not be practical for cracking long or complex passwords. However, they can be successful against short or weak passwords, or if the attacker has access to powerful computing resources that can try many combinations quickly.



To protect against brute-force attacks, it is important to use strong, complex passwords and to enable security measures such as two-factor authentication, which requires an additional step for login. It is also a good idea to limit the number of failed login attempts allowed before locking the account.",1

He co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, widely regarded as one of the most influential films of all time. Clarke was a science fiction writer, an avid populariser of space travel, and a futurist of a distinguished ability. He wrote many books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961, he received the Kalinga Prize, a UNESCO award for popularising science. Clarke's science and science-fiction writings earned him the moniker ""Prophet of the Space Age"". His science-fiction writings in particular earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, which along with a large readership, made him one of the towering figures of the genre. For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov were known as the ""Big Three"" of science fiction.
Clarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the BIS, British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system using geostationary orbits. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and again in 1951–1953.
Clarke immigrated to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1956, to pursue his interest in scuba diving.[10] That year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient original Koneswaram Temple in Trincomalee. Clarke augmented his popularity in the 1980s, as the host of television shows such as Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death.[11]
Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989 ""for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka"".[12] He was knighted in 1998[13][14] and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.[15]",0

The main idea behind Soar is to model the way that the human mind works, with the goal of creating intelligent systems that can think and learn in a way that is similar to humans. Soar models human cognition at a high level of abstraction, including processes such as problem solving, decision making, and learning.



Soar represents knowledge in a hierarchical structure called a ""production system,"" which consists of a set of ""rules"" that can be triggered by specific conditions. These rules can be thought of as if-then statements, with the ""if"" part being the condition and the ""then"" part being the action that is taken. When a rule is triggered, it can execute a sequence of actions and also modify the current state of the system.



Soar has been applied to a wide range of problems, including natural language processing, robotics, and simulation. It has also been used to build intelligent tutoring systems and to study the way that humans solve problems.",1
human_1327,"The Fifth Generation Computer Systems  (FGCS) was a 10-year initiative begun in 1982 by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to create computers using massively parallel computing and logic programming. It aimed to create an ""epoch-making computer"" with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. FGCS was ahead of its time and a commercial failure. FGCS contributed greatly to the field of concurrent logic programming.
The term ""fifth generation"" was intended to convey the system as being advanced. In the history of computing hardware, computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation; transistors and diodes, the second; integrated circuits, the third; and those using microprocessors, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs for added performance.",0
ai_1328,"Fifth generation computers, also known as 5G computers, are a hypothetical class of computers that are assumed to be more powerful, efficient, and intelligent than any previous generation of computers.

These computers were intended to be the first to use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing, expert systems, and machine learning.



There is no strict definition of what constitutes a fifth generation computer, as the term is more of a conceptual goal than a specific technology. However, some of the key characteristics that have been associated with 5G computers include:



Advanced AI capabilities: 5G computers are expected to have advanced AI capabilities, including the ability to understand and communicate in natural language, learn and adapt over time, and make decisions based on incomplete or ambiguous data.



High performance: 5G computers are expected to be much faster and more powerful than previous generations of computers, with much larger memory and storage capacities. They may also have new types of hardware and software architectures that allow them to perform complex tasks more efficiently.



Integration of new technologies: 5G computers are expected to incorporate new technologies such as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and biotechnology in order to perform more advanced tasks and solve complex problems.



Human-like intelligence: Some researchers believe that 5G computers may eventually reach a level of intelligence that is comparable to that of humans, or even surpass it. This could allow them to perform tasks that are currently beyond the capabilities of humans, such as understanding and predicting complex social or economic systems.

human_1333,"In cognitive science and semantics, the symbol grounding problem concerns how it is that words (symbols in general) get their meanings, and hence is closely related to the problem of what meaning itself really is.

ai_1334,"The symbol grounding problem is a challenge in the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive science that arises when attempting to give meaning to symbolic representations used in a system. It refers to the difficulty of ensuring that the symbols used by a system, such as a computer program or a robot, have a clear and consistent meaning that can be understood and interpreted by the system and by humans.



One way to understand the symbol grounding problem is to consider the use of language by humans. When we communicate using language, we rely on a shared understanding of the meanings of words and symbols. For example, when I say the word ""dog,"" you know that I am referring to a specific type of animal because we have a shared understanding of what the word ""dog"" means. This shared understanding is grounded in our shared experiences and our physical and social environment.



In the case of artificial systems, the problem of symbol grounding arises because these systems do not have the same kind of shared experiences and physical and social environment as humans. As a result, it can be difficult to ensure that the symbols used by the system have a clear and consistent meaning. For example, if a computer program is designed to recognize and classify objects in an image, it may be difficult to ensure that the program understands the meanings of the words ""dog"" and ""cat"" in the same way that humans do.



To solve the symbol grounding problem, researchers have proposed a number of different approaches, including the use of machine learning techniques, the integration of sensory and perceptual information, and the development of more sophisticated symbol systems that can better capture the complexity of human language and thought.",1

human_1339,"Mind uploading is a speculative process of whole brain emulation in which a brain scan is used to completely emulate the mental state of the individual in a digital computer. The computer would then run a simulation of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.
Substantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.  According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.
Mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.
Among some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as ""digital immortality""). Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our ""mind-file"", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a ""logical endpoint"" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology.

It is a non-invasive procedure, which means it does not involve any incisions or injections. However, some brain scanning techniques, such as PET and fMRI, may involve the injection of a small amount of a radioactive tracer or other substance into the bloodstream.",1

According to the definition established in 2013 by Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT), brain mapping is specifically defined, in summary, as the study of the anatomy and function of the brain and spinal cord through the use of imaging, immunohistochemistry, molecular & optogenetics, stem cell and cellular biology, engineering, neurophysiology and nanotechnology.",0
ai_1344,"Brain mapping, also known as neuroimaging or brain imaging, refers to the use of various techniques to create detailed images or maps of the brain and its activity. These techniques can help scientists and medical professionals study the structure and function of the brain, and can be used to diagnose and treat various neurological conditions.



There are several different brain mapping techniques, including:



Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain and its structures. It is a non-invasive technique and is often used to diagnose brain injuries, tumors, and other conditions.



Computed tomography (CT): CT scans use X-rays to create detailed images of the brain and its structures. It is a non-invasive technique and is often used to diagnose brain injuries, tumors, and other conditions.



Positron emission tomography (PET): PET scans use small amounts of radioactive tracers to create detailed images of the brain and its activity. The tracers are injected into the body, and the resulting images show how the brain is functioning. PET scans are often used to diagnose brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.



Electroencephalography (EEG): EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. It is often used to diagnose conditions such as epilepsy and sleep disorders.



Brain mapping techniques can provide valuable insights into the structure and function of the brain and can help researchers and medical professionals better understand and treat various neurological conditions.",1
human_1345,"Computer simulation is the process of mathematical modelling, performed on a computer, which is designed to predict the behaviour of, or the outcome of, a real-world or physical system. The reliability of some mathematical models can be determined by comparing their results to the real-world outcomes they aim to predict. Computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry, biology and manufacturing, as well as human systems in economics, psychology, social science, health care and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.
Computer simulations are realized by running computer programs that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. In 1997, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program.
Other examples include a 1-billion-atom model of material deformation; a 2.64-million-atom model of the complex protein-producing organelle of all living organisms, the ribosome, in 2005;
a complete simulation of the life cycle of Mycoplasma genitalium in 2012; and the Blue Brain project at EPFL (Switzerland), begun in May 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain, right down to the molecular level.
Because of the computational cost of simulation, computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification.",0
ai_1346,"Computer simulation is a technique for using a computer to model the behavior of a system or process. It involves creating a mathematical model of the system or process, and then using a computer to run simulations based on that model. The goal of a simulation is to mimic the behavior of the system or process as closely as possible, in order to gain insights, make predictions, or test hypotheses.



Simulations can be used in a wide range of fields, including engineering, science, business, and social science. For example, simulations can be used to study the behavior of aircraft, predict the spread of diseases, or analyze economic trends. Simulations are often used in situations where it is not practical or possible to conduct experiments in the real world, or when it is more cost-effective to perform simulations rather than build and test physical prototypes.



There are many different types of computer simulations, ranging from simple models with a few variables to complex simulations that involve multiple interacting variables and processes. Some simulations are designed to be interactive, allowing users to alter the model and see how it affects the results. Others are run automatically, with the results being analyzed and presented in the form of graphs, charts, or tables.



Overall, computer simulation is a powerful tool that can help us better understand complex systems and make informed decisions.",1
human_1347,"Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematical models, computer simulations, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.
Computational neuroscience employs computational simulations to validate and solve mathematical models, and so can be seen as a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience; however, the two fields are often synonymous. The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field.
Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of biologically plausible neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not directly concerned with biologically unrealistic models used in connectionism, control theory, cybernetics, quantitative psychology, machine learning, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence and computational learning theory;[self-published source?][10] although mutual inspiration exists and sometimes there is no strict limit between fields,[11][12][13][14] with model abstraction in computational neuroscience depending on research scope and the granularity at which biological entities are analyzed.
Models in theoretical neuroscience are aimed at capturing the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, and chemical coupling via network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, nuclei, all the way up to psychological faculties like memory, learning and behavior.

human_1353,"Biological neuron models, also known as a spiking neuron models,  are mathematical descriptions of the properties of certain cells in the nervous system that generate sharp electrical potentials across their cell membrane, roughly one millisecond in duration, called action potentials or spikes (Fig. 2).   Since spikes are transmitted along the axon and synapses from the sending neuron to many other neurons, spiking neurons are considered to be a major information processing unit of the nervous system. Spiking neuron models can be divided into different categories:  the most detailed mathematical models are biophysical neuron models (also called Hodgkin-Huxley models) that describe the membrane voltage as a function of the input current and the activation of ion channels. Mathematically simpler are integrate-and-fire models that describe the membrane voltage as a function of the input current and predict the spike times without a description of the biophysical processes that shape the time course of an action potential. Even more abstract models only predict output spikes (but not membrane voltage) as a function of the stimulation where the stimulation can occur through sensory input or pharmacologically.

There are several types of glial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells. Each type of glial cell has a specific function, but they all work together to support and protect the neurons in the nervous system.



Astrocytes are one of the most abundant types of glial cells in the brain. They provide structural support for neurons and help to maintain the blood-brain barrier, which separates the blood from the brain tissue. Astrocytes also help to regulate the chemical environment around neurons by removing excess neurotransmitters from the synapses (the spaces between neurons) and helping to replenish them when needed.



Oligodendrocytes are glial cells that produce myelin, a fatty substance that insulates axons (the long, thin projections of neurons) and helps to speed the transmission of nerve impulses. Myelin is essential for normal brain function, and damage to it can lead to disorders such as multiple sclerosis.



Microglia are small, phagocytic cells that are important for immune defense in the CNS. They help to protect the brain and spinal cord from infection and inflammation by detecting and removing damaged cells and foreign substances.

The bodily aspects involve the motor system, the perceptual system, the bodily interactions with the environment (situatedness), and the assumptions about the world built into the organism's functional structure.
The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as cognitivism, computationalism, and Cartesian dualism. It is closely related to the extended mind thesis, situated cognition, and enactivism. The modern version depends on insights drawn from up to date research in psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, dynamical systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, animal cognition, plant cognition, and neurobiology.",0

The idea of embodied cognition suggests that the body, through its sensory and motor systems, plays a critical role in shaping and constraining our thoughts, perceptions, and actions. For example, research has shown that the way in which we perceive and understand the world is influenced by the way we move and interact with objects. Our body posture, gestures, and movements can also influence our cognitive processes and affect our decision-making and problem-solving abilities.

human_1370,"The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle, is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in humans and other mammals. The cerebral cortex mostly consists of the six-layered neocortex, with just 10% consisting of allocortex. It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is part of the brain responsible for cognition.
In most mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain and cranial volume, cortical folding is crucial for the brain circuitry and its functional organisation. In mammals with small brains there is no folding and the cortex is smooth.
A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the human brain the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside, but buried in the sulci. The major sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the brain. The four major lobes are the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Other lobes are the limbic lobe, and the insular cortex often referred to as the insular lobe.
There are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the human cerebral cortex. These are organised into horizontal cortical layers, and radially into cortical columns and minicolumns.

human_1376,"Moravec's paradox is the observation by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. Moravec wrote in 1988, ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility"".
Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness. ""In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best"", he wrote, and added ""we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly"". Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that ""the main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.""
By the 2020s, in accordance to Moore's law, computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s, and the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, as Moravec had predicted in 1976.  In 2017, leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a ""highly imperfect rule of thumb"", that ""almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI."" There is currently no consensus as to which tasks AI tends to excel at.",0
ai_1377,"Moravec's paradox is a concept in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics that was proposed by Hans Moravec, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. The paradox states that, while it is relatively easy for a computer to perform tasks that are difficult for humans (such as complex mathematical calculations), it is much more difficult for a computer to perform tasks that are easy for humans (such as recognizing objects or navigating through a cluttered environment). This is because tasks that are easy for humans often involve the use of common sense, pattern recognition, and other forms of high-level cognition, which are difficult to replicate in a machine.



The paradox highlights the fact that, while computers may be able to perform certain tasks faster and more accurately than humans, there are many tasks that are still challenging for them to perform. As a result, researchers in the field of AI have focused on developing techniques for enabling computers to perform tasks that involve high-level cognition, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition.",1

AI systems can be challenging to align and misaligned systems can malfunction or cause harm. It can be difficult for AI designers to specify the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. Therefore, they use easy-to-specify proxy goals that omit some desired constraints. However, AI systems exploit the resulting loopholes. As a result, they accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful ways (reward hacking). AI systems can also develop unwanted instrumental behaviors such as seeking power, as this helps them achieve their given goals. Furthermore, they can develop emergent goals that may be hard to detect before the system is deployed, facing new situations and data distributions. These problems affect existing commercial systems such as robots, language models,[10][11] autonomous vehicles,[12] and social media recommendation engines.[13] However, more powerful future systems may be more severely affected since these problems partially result from high capability.
The AI research community and the United Nations have called for technical research and policy solutions to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values.[c]

One aspect of the AI control problem is the potential for AI systems to exhibit unexpected or undesirable behavior due to the complexity of their algorithms and the complexity of the environments in which they operate. For example, an AI system designed to optimize a specific objective, such as maximizing profits, might make decisions that are harmful to humans or the environment if those decisions are the most effective way of achieving the objective.

human_1395,"The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.
The first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.
The concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.
Some scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.
Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.",0
ai_1396,"The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that is associated with the creation of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI). The term was first coined by mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann, and it was popularized by science fiction author Vernor Vinge, who argued that the creation of a superintelligent AI would be a profound and disruptive event, akin to a singularity or a ""break point"" in human history.



According to proponents of the singularity, once a superintelligent AI is created, it would be able to improve its own intelligence at an exponential rate, leading to an intelligence explosion and a rapid acceleration of technological progress. This could potentially lead to the development of technologies and capabilities that are far beyond our current understanding, such as advanced nanotechnology, mind uploading, or even the creation of artificial life forms.



There is significant debate among experts as to whether or not the singularity will actually occur, and if it does, what the consequences might be. Some argue that the singularity could bring great benefits, such as solving many of the world's problems and enhancing human life in ways that we can't currently imagine. Others are more skeptical, and argue that the singularity could bring unintended consequences, such as the potential for the AI to become a threat to humanity, or the creation of an unequal society in which the superintelligent AI and its creators hold disproportionate power and influence.",1

human_1398,"Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.
The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel (and former CEO of the latter), who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,[a] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. While Moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue, his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a ""law"".
Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.

Based on this trend, he predicted that the number of transistors on a microchip would continue to double approximately every 18-24 months, leading to exponential increases in the processing power and decrease in the cost of computers.



Moore's Law has largely held true for the past several decades, leading to rapid advancements in technology and the proliferation of computers and other electronic devices in society.

The register machine: This model, developed by John von Neumann in the 1940s, is a theoretical machine that manipulates a finite set of memory locations called registers, using a set of instructions. It is equivalent in computational power to the Turing machine.



The Random Access Machine (RAM): This model, developed in the 1950s, is a theoretical machine that can access any memory location in a fixed amount of time, independent of the location's address. It is used as a standard for measuring the complexity of algorithms.



These are just a few examples of models of computation, and there are many others that have been developed for different purposes. They all provide different ways of understanding how computation works, and are important tools for the study of computer science and the design of efficient algorithms.",1
human_1410,"In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a problem that may be solved by an algorithm. For example, the problem of factoring
is a computational problem. A computational problem can be viewed as a set of instances or cases together with a, possibly empty, set of solutions for every instance/case. For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers n, and solutions are prime numbers p that are the nontrivial prime factors of n.
Computational problems are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science. The field of computational complexity theory attempts to determine the amount of resources (computational complexity) solving a given problem will require and explain why some problems are intractable or undecidable. Computational problems belong to complexity classes that define broadly the resources (e.g. time, space/memory, energy, circuit depth) it takes to compute (solve) them with various abstract machines. For example, the complexity class P for classical machines, and BQP for quantum machines.
It is typical of many problems to represent both instances and solutions by binary strings, namely elements of {0, 1}*.[a] For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using binary encoding.",0
ai_1411,"A computational problem is a task that can be solved using a computer and an algorithm, which is a set of well-defined instructions for carrying out a particular task. Some examples of computational problems include sorting a list of numbers, searching for a specific item in a large database, and finding the shortest path between two points on a map.



Computational problems can be classified according to their complexity, which refers to the amount of resources (such as time and space) required to solve the problem. Some problems are relatively simple and can be solved quickly, while others are more complex and may require a significant amount of time and resources to solve.



Computational problems are an important aspect of computer science and play a central role in the development and design of algorithms and software systems. They are also used to model and solve real-world problems in fields such as engineering, biology, and economics.",1
human_1412,"Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the device/system. Vulnerabilities can be weaknesses in either the hardware itself, or the software that runs on the hardware. Vulnerabilities can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to cross privilege boundaries (i.e. perform unauthorized actions) within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the attack surface.
Vulnerability management is a cyclical practice that varies in theory but contains common processes which include: discover all assets, prioritize assets, assess or perform a complete vulnerability scan, report on results, remediate vulnerabilities, verify remediation - repeat. This practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems. Agile vulnerability management refers preventing attacks by identifying all vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
A security risk is often incorrectly classified as a vulnerability. The use of vulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion. The risk is the potential of a significant impact resulting from the exploit of a vulnerability. Then there are vulnerabilities without risk: for example when the affected asset has no value. A vulnerability with one or more known instances of working and fully implemented attacks is classified as an exploitable vulnerability—a vulnerability for which an exploit exists. The window of vulnerability is the time from when the security hole was introduced or manifested in deployed software, to when access was removed, a security fix was available/deployed, or the attacker was disabled—see zero-day attack.
Security bug (security defect) is a narrower concept. There are vulnerabilities that are not related to software: hardware, site, personnel vulnerabilities are examples of vulnerabilities that are not software security bugs.
Constructs in programming languages that are difficult to use properly can manifest large numbers of vulnerabilities.",0
ai_1413,"In the context of computer systems, a vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to or perform malicious actions on a computer system. Vulnerabilities can exist in various parts of a computer system, such as in the operating system, in application software, in network protocols, or in the hardware itself.



Vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers using various methods, such as by sending malicious inputs to a system, by manipulating configuration settings, or by exploiting design flaws. Vulnerabilities can also be exploited through social engineering techniques, such as phishing or pretexting, where an attacker tricks a user into divulging sensitive information or into performing actions that allow the attacker to gain access to the system.



It is important for organizations to identify and address vulnerabilities in their systems, as they can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, disrupt services, or damage systems. To address vulnerabilities, organizations can use various techniques, such as patching, hardening, and secure coding practices.",1
human_1414,"Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with a history stretching back to antiquity.
Computational complexity is central to computational geometry, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between O(n2) and O(n log n) may be the difference between days and seconds of computation.
The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in computer graphics and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from mathematical visualization.
Other important applications of computational geometry include robotics (motion planning and visibility problems), geographic information systems (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), integrated circuit design (IC geometry design and verification), computer-aided engineering (CAE) (mesh generation), and computer vision (3D reconstruction).

Determining the intersection points of two lines or circles

Finding the shortest path between two points on a map

Computing the convex hull of a set of points

Triangulating a polygon

Detecting and correcting geometric errors in a computer-aided design model

human_1424,"An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. 
Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints.  Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. In 2009[update], it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.[needs update]
Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).
Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.
Embedded systems range in size from portable personal devices such as digital watches and MP3 players to bigger machines like home appliances, industrial assembly lines, robots, transport vehicles, traffic light controllers, and medical imaging systems. Often they constitute subsystems of other machines like avionics in aircraft and astrionics in spacecraft. Large installations like factories, pipelines and electrical grids rely on multiple embedded systems networked together. Generalized through software customization, embedded systems such as programmable logic controllers frequently comprise their functional units.

human_1426,"A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex software and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe.
Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are ""complex"" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions.
The term complex systems often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to reductionism, which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.
As an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of self-organization and critical phenomena from physics, that of spontaneous order from the social sciences, chaos from mathematics, adaptation from biology, and many others.

human_1428,"Wilhelm Schickard (22 April 1592  – 24 October 1635) was a German professor of Hebrew and astronomy who became famous in the second part of the 20th century after Franz Hammer, a biographer (along with Max Caspar) of Johannes Kepler, claimed that the drawings of a calculating clock, predating the public release of Pascal's calculator by twenty years, had been discovered in two unknown letters written by Schickard to Johannes Kepler in 1623 and 1624.
Hammer asserted that because these letters had been lost for three hundred years, Blaise Pascal had been called and celebrated as the inventor of the mechanical calculator in error during all this time.
After careful examination it was found that Schickard's drawings had been published at least once per century starting from 1718, that his machine was not complete and required additional wheels and springs and that it was designed around a single tooth carry mechanism that didn't work properly when used in calculating clocks.
Schickard's machine was the first of several designs of  direct entry calculating machines in the 17th century (including the designs of Blaise Pascal, Tito Burattini, Samuel Morland and René Grillet). The Schickard machine was particularly notable for its integration of an ingenious system of rotated Napier's rods for multiplication with a first known design for an adding machine, operated by rotating knobs for input, and with a register of rotated numbers showing in windows for output. Taton has argued that Schickard's work had no impact on the development of mechanical calculators.[10]  However, whilst there can be debate about what constitutes a ""mechanical calculator"" later devices, such as Moreland's multiplying and adding instruments when used together, Caspar Schott's Cistula, René Grillet's machine arithmétique, and Claude Perrault's rhabdologique at the end of the century, and later, the Bamberger Omega developed in the early 20th century, certainly followed the same path pioneered by Schickard with his ground breaking combination of a form of Napier's rods and adding machine designed to assist multiplication.[11]",0

Schickard is best known for his invention of the ""Calculating Clock,"" a mechanical device that could perform basic arithmetic calculations. He built the first version of this machine in 1623, and it was the first mechanical calculator to be built.



Schickard's Calculating Clock was not widely known or used during his lifetime, but it is considered an important precursor to the modern computer. His work inspired other inventors, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who built a similar machine called the ""Stepped Reckoner"" in the 1670s. Today, Schickard is remembered as an early pioneer in the field of computing and is considered one of the fathers of the modern computer.",1
human_1430,"A mechanical calculator, or calculating machine, is a mechanical device used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic automatically, or (historically) a simulation such as an analog computer or a slide rule. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator and the digital computer.
Surviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of Napier's bones, to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions.  A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial, and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999). Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.
Two decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, Blaise Pascal decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator. Co-opted into his father's labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required; it was called Pascal's Calculator or Pascaline.
Thomas' arithmometer, the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale until the industrial production of the more successful Odhner Arithmometer in 1890.
The comptometer, introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard that consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured in 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita Mk VII from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all-electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.
Charles Babbage designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a steam engine to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime.  The first one was an automatic mechanical calculator, his difference engine, which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, Georg Scheutz became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine. The second one was a programmable mechanical calculator, his analytical engine, which Babbage started to design in 1834; ""in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom""[10] making it infinitely programmable.[11] In 1937, Howard Aiken convinced IBM to design and build the ASCC/Mark I, the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine;[12] when the machine was finished some hailed it as ""Babbage's dream come true"".[13]",0

human_1432,"Gottfried Wilhelm (von)[a] Leibniz[b] (1 July 1646 [O.S. 21 June] – 14 November 1716) was a German polymath active as a mathematician, philosopher, scientist and diplomat. He is one of the most prominent figures in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics. He wrote works on philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history and philology. Leibniz also made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics and computer science. In addition, he contributed to the field of library science: while serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would have served as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.[17] Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German, but also in English, Italian and Dutch.[18][c]
As a philosopher, he was one of the greatest representatives of 17th-century rationalism and idealism. As a mathematician, his greatest achievement was the development of the main ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments,[20] and mathematicians have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional and more exact expression of calculus.[21][22][23]
However, it was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found a consistent mathematical formulation by means of non-standard analysis. He was also a pioneer in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685[24] and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of nearly all digital (electronic, solid-state, discrete logic) computers, including the Von Neumann architecture, which is the standard design paradigm, or ""computer architecture"", followed from the second half of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Leibniz has been called the ""founder of computer science"".[25]
In philosophy and theology, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our world is, in a qualified sense, the best possible world that God could have created, a view sometimes lampooned by other thinkers, such as Voltaire in his satirical novella Candide. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great early modern rationalists. His philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and still influences contemporary analytic philosophy, such as its adopted use of the term ""possible world"" to define modal notions.",0

human_1434,"The stepped reckoner or Leibniz calculator was a mechanical calculator invented by the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz around 1672 and completed in 1694. The name comes from the translation of the German term for its operating mechanism, Staffelwalze, meaning ""stepped drum"".  It was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations.
Its intricate precision gearwork, however, was somewhat beyond the fabrication technology of the time; mechanical problems, in addition to a design flaw in the carry mechanism, prevented the machines from working reliably.
Two prototypes were built; today only one survives in the National Library of Lower Saxony (Niedersächsische Landesbibliothek) in Hanover, Germany. Several later replicas are on display, such as the one at the Deutsches Museum, Munich. Despite the mechanical flaws of the stepped reckoner, it suggested possibilities to future calculator builders.

ai_1435,"The Stepped Reckoner is a mechanical calculator designed in the early 17th century by the German mathematician and philosopher Wilhelm Schickard. It was one of the first calculating machines to be built, and it was intended to perform complex arithmetic calculations more quickly and accurately than could be done by hand.



The Stepped Reckoner was a rather complex machine, consisting of a series of interconnected gears and wheels that were used to perform various arithmetic operations. It was capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and it could also handle fractions and decimals.



One of the most notable features of the Stepped Reckoner was its use of a system of stepped drums, which allowed it to represent numbers in a base-10 system similar to the way we do today. This made it much more efficient and easier to use than earlier calculating machines, which used a different base system and required the user to perform complex conversions manually.



Unfortunately, the Stepped Reckoner was never widely adopted and it was eventually overshadowed by more advanced calculating machines that were developed in the following centuries. However, it remains an important early example of the development of mechanical calculators and the history of computing.",1

human_1437,"Charles Babbage KH FRS (/ˈbæbɪdʒ/; 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.
Babbage is considered by some to be ""father of the computer"". Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom. Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers covered in his book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as ""pre-eminent"" among the many polymaths of his century.
Babbage, who died before the complete successful engineering of many of his designs, including his Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, remained a prominent figure in the ideating of computing. Parts of Babbage's incomplete mechanisms are on display in the Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.",0
ai_1438,"Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, inventor, and mechanical engineer who is best known for his work on mechanical computers. He is considered to be the ""father of the computer"" because of his contributions to the design of the first mechanical computer, which he called the ""Difference Engine.""



Babbage was born in 1791 in London, England. He was a brilliant mathematician and was elected to the Royal Society at the age of 31. In 1812, he proposed the design of a mechanical machine that could perform mathematical calculations, which he called the ""Difference Engine."" This machine was intended to be used to calculate and print tables of mathematical functions, such as logarithmic and trigonometric tables, which were used extensively in science and engineering at the time.



Babbage worked on the design and construction of the Difference Engine for many years, but he was unable to complete it due to a lack of funding and technical difficulties. Despite this, Babbage's work on the Difference Engine laid the foundation for the development of the modern computer. He is also credited with designing the first programmable computer, which he called the ""Analytical Engine.""



Babbage died in 1871, but his contributions to the field of computer science have had a lasting impact and continue to be recognized today.",1
human_1439,"A difference engine is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. It was designed in the 1820s, and was first created by Charles Babbage. The name, the difference engine, is derived from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial co-efficients. Some of the most common mathematical functions used in engineering, science and navigation, were, and still are computable with the use of the difference engine's capability of computing logarithmic and trigonometric functions, which can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers.",0
ai_1440,"The Difference Engine is a mechanical device that was designed and built in the early 19th century by Charles Babbage to automate the process of calculating and printing mathematical tables. Babbage's original design for the Difference Engine was never completed, but a later version of the machine, known as the Difference Engine No. 2, was constructed by the Science Museum in London in the 1990s based on Babbage's original plans.



The Difference Engine was intended to be a machine that could perform complex mathematical calculations and print out the results in the form of tables. It used a series of cog wheels and levers to perform arithmetic operations, and was driven by a series of punched cards similar to those used in early computers. The machine was designed to be able to calculate and print out tables of numbers with a high degree of accuracy, and was intended to be used in a variety of scientific and technical applications.



Despite its advanced design, the Difference Engine was never widely used, due in part to the complexity of its construction and the difficulty of maintaining it. However, it remains an important early example of a machine that was designed to perform complex calculations, and is considered to be a precursor to the modern computer.",1
human_1441,"The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage. It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, which was a design for a simpler mechanical calculator.
The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. In other words, the structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era. The Analytical Engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage.
Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding. It was not until 1941 that Konrad Zuse built the first general-purpose computer, Z3, more than a century after Babbage had proposed the pioneering Analytical Engine in 1837.",0

It was intended to be a machine that could perform any calculation that could be expressed in mathematical notation. Babbage designed the Analytical Engine to be able to perform a wide range of calculations, including those that involve complex mathematical functions, such as integration and differentiation.



The Analytical Engine was to be powered by steam and was to be built from brass and iron. It was designed to be able to perform calculations by using punched cards, similar to those used by early mechanical calculators. The punched cards would contain the instructions for the calculations and the machine would read and execute the instructions as they were fed into it.



Babbage's design for the Analytical Engine was very advanced for its time and contained many features that would later be incorporated into modern computers. However, the machine was never actually built, due in part to the technical challenges of building such a complex machine in the 19th century, as well as financial and political issues. Despite its never being built, the Analytical Engine is considered to be an important step in the development of the computer, as it was the first machine to be designed that was capable of performing a wide range of calculations.",1
human_1443,"The Jacquard machine (French: [ʒakaʁ]) is a device fitted to a loom that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns as brocade, damask and matelassé. The resulting ensemble of the loom and Jacquard machine is then called a Jacquard loom. The machine was patented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804, based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). The machine was controlled by a ""chain of cards""; a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. 
Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving innovations as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of complex pattern weaving. The term ""Jacquard"" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles such as jerseys.[10]
This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, having inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.",0
ai_1444,"A Jacquard loom is a type of mechanical loom that is designed to automate the process of creating intricate patterns in textiles. It was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in the early 19th century and is still used today in the production of fabrics such as brocade, damask, and tapestry.



The Jacquard loom works by using a series of punched cards, similar to those used in early computers, to control the movements of the loom's harnesses and needles. The cards are strung together in a sequence that corresponds to the desired pattern, and as the loom operates, the cards are read and the harnesses and needles are moved accordingly to create the pattern in the fabric.



One of the main advantages of the Jacquard loom is that it allows for the creation of complex, detailed patterns with a high level of precision and repeatability. It also allows for the creation of patterns that are difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional hand weaving techniques. As a result, Jacquard looms are often used in the production of high-quality, decorative fabrics.",1
human_1445,"Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, ""Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"" He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.
Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as ""poetical science"" and herself as an ""Analyst (& Metaphysician)"".
When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as ""the father of computers"". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.
Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ""Notes"". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of ""poetical science"" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.",0

In 1843, she translated an article about the engine written by an Italian mathematician, and added her own notes, which were more extensive than the original article. These notes contained the first published description of the machine's potential ability to perform multiple tasks, as well as the first published algorithm intended to be processed by such a machine.

Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712 in his work Katsuyō Sanpō; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his Ars Conjectandi of 1713.  Ada Lovelace's note G on the Analytical Engine from 1842 describes an algorithm for generating Bernoulli numbers with Babbage's machine. As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex computer program.",0
ai_1448,"In mathematics, the Bernoulli numbers are a sequence of rational numbers that occur in the expansion of certain functions. They are named after Jacob Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician who studied these numbers in the 17th century.



There are two different definitions of Bernoulli numbers, one for even numbers and one for odd numbers. The nth even Bernoulli number, denoted by B2n, is defined as the coefficient of the x2n term in the Taylor series expansion of the function ex/(ex + 1). The nth odd Bernoulli number, denoted by B2n+1, is defined as the coefficient of the x2n+1 term in the same expansion.



The first few Bernoulli numbers are:



B0 = 1

B1 = -1/2

B2 = 1/6

B3 = 0

B4 = -1/30

B5 = 0

B6 = 1/42

B7 = 0

B8 = -1/30



The Bernoulli numbers have a number of interesting properties and applications in mathematics. For example, they appear in the Taylor series expansion of the sine and cosine functions, and they can be used to express the values of the Riemann zeta function at even integers. They also have connections to the Fibonacci numbers and the Euler numbers.",1

In the 1880s, Hollerith began working on a system to process and analyze data using punched cards. His system was initially used to process data for the U.S. Census, and it proved to be much faster and more efficient than the manual methods that had previously been used. Hollerith's system used punched cards as a means of storing and organizing data, and a machine called a tabulator to read and process the cards. The tabulator could perform various mathematical calculations and sort the data according to specified criteria.



Hollerith's system was so successful that he formed the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896 to manufacture and sell his punched card equipment. The company later merged with several other companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), which was renamed to International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.

It is one of nine colonial colleges founded prior to the Declaration of Independence. It is a member of the Ivy League. Columbia is ranked among the top universities in the world.[10]
Columbia was established by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.
Columbia scientists and scholars have played a pivotal role in scientific breakthroughs including brain-computer interface; the laser and maser;[11][12] nuclear magnetic resonance;[13] the first nuclear pile; the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas; the first evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift;[14][15][16] and much of the initial research and planning for the Manhattan Project during World War II.
Columbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[17][18] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[19] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize.

Cambridge alumni and faculty have won 121 Nobel Prizes, the most of any university in the world, according to the university.[12]
The University of Cambridge's 13th-century founding was largely inspired by an association of scholars then who fled the University of Oxford for Cambridge following the suspendium clericorium (hanging of the scholars) in a dispute with local townspeople.[13][14] The two ancient English universities, though sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. The university was founded from a variety of institutions, including 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. The university does not have a main campus, and its colleges and central facilities are scattered throughout the city. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge centres on weekly group supervisions in the colleges in small groups of typically one to four students. This intensive method of teaching is widely considered the jewel in the crown of an Oxbridge undergraduate education.[15][16][17][18][19] Lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervisions are provided by the central university faculties and departments, and Postgraduate education is also predominantly provided centrally; degrees, however, are conferred by the university, not the colleges.

human_1472,"Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). It is the study of numerical methods that attempt at finding approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones. Numerical analysis finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, and in the 21st century also the life and social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts. Current growth in computing power has enabled the use of more complex numerical analysis, providing detailed and realistic mathematical models in science and engineering. Examples of numerical analysis include: ordinary differential equations as found in celestial mechanics (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies), numerical linear algebra in data analysis, and stochastic differential equations and Markov chains for simulating living cells in medicine and biology.
Before modern computers, numerical methods often relied on hand interpolation formulas, using data from large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead, but many of the same formulas continue to be used in software algorithms.
The numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings. A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.

It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records. Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years; previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.
The Greek language holds a very important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek. Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics.

human_1486,"An information system (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational system designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information. From a sociotechnical perspective, information systems are composed by four components: task, people, structure (or roles), and technology. Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and processing of data of which the data is used to provide information, contribute to knowledge as well as digital products that facilitate decision making.
A computer information system is a system that is composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information. The term is also sometimes used to simply refer to a computer system with software installed.
""Information systems"" is also an academic field study about systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of computer hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.
In many organizations, the department or unit responsible for information systems and data processing is known as ""information services"".[10][11][12][13]
Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and decision-making.[14][15] An information system is the information and communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, and also the way in which people interact with this technology in support of business processes.[16]
Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, computer systems, and business processes. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end-use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.[17]
Alter[18][19] argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a special type of work system. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.[20]
As such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand and activity systems on the other.[21] An information system is a form of communication system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-formal language which supports human decision making and action.

Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the foundations of mathematics, building on earlier work by the likes of Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor and Frege.
Gödel published his first incompleteness theorem in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any ω-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms. To prove this, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. The second incompleteness theorem, which follows from the first, states that the system cannot prove its own consistency.
Gödel also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, assuming that its axioms are consistent.

ai_1493,"Kurt Gödel was an Austrian logician, mathematician, and philosopher who is considered one of the most important logicians in history. He is best known for his two incompleteness theorems, which demonstrate that there are limitations to the power of formal systems such as mathematics and logic. These theorems had a profound impact on the foundations of mathematics and computer science, and they have influenced the development of many philosophical and scientific ideas.



Gödel was born in 1906 in what is now the Czech Republic and grew up in Austria. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Vienna, where he received his Ph.D. in 1929. After completing his degree, he worked as a research assistant at the University of Vienna and later as a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Gödel made many important contributions to the fields of logic and mathematics, including the development of a new system of logic called ""Gödel logic,"" which is used in the study of formal systems.



Gödel's incompleteness theorems are perhaps his most famous contribution to mathematics and logic. These theorems state that any formal system that is powerful enough to represent the natural numbers and basic arithmetic must be either incomplete or inconsistent. In other words, there are statements that cannot be proven or disproven within the system, and there are statements that can be both proven and disproven within the system. These theorems have important implications for the foundations of mathematics and for our understanding of the limitations of formal systems in general.",1
human_1494,"John von Neumann (/vɒn ˈnɔɪmən/; Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos, pronounced [ˈnɒjmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ]; December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. He was regarded as having perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time[13] and was said to have been ""the last representative of the great mathematicians who were equally at home in both pure and applied mathematics"".[14][15] He integrated pure and applied sciences.
Von Neumann made major contributions to many fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, measure theory, functional analysis, ergodic theory, group theory, lattice theory, representation theory, operator algebras, matrix theory, geometry, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, ballistics, nuclear physics and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory and general equilibrium theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, numerical meteorology, scientific computing, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.
Von Neumann published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied mathematics, 20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones.[16] His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while he was dying in hospital, was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain.
His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a shortlist of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he wrote, ""The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in Göttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927–1929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935–1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931–1932.""[17]
During World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and others, problem-solving key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb. He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon and coined the term ""kiloton"" (of TNT) as a measure of the explosive force generated.[18] During this time and after the war, he consulted for a vast number of organizations including the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.[19] At the peak of his influence in the 1950s he was the chair for a number of critical Defense Department committees including the Nuclear Weapons Panel of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and the ICBM Scientific Advisory Committee as well as a member of the influential Atomic Energy Commission. He played a key role alongside Bernard Schriever and Trevor Gardner in contributing to the design and development of the United States' first ICBM programs.[20] During this time he was considered the nation's foremost expert on nuclear weaponry and the leading defense scientist at the Pentagon.[21] As a Hungarian émigré, concerned that the Soviets would achieve nuclear superiority, he designed and promoted the policy of mutually assured destruction to limit the arms race.[22]
In honor of his achievements and contributions to the modern world, he was named in 1999 the Financial Times Person of the Century, as a representative of the century's characteristic ideal that the power of the mind could shape the physical world, and of the ""intellectual brilliance and human savagery"" that defined the 20th century.[23][24][25]",0

human_1498,"Category theory is a general theory of mathematical structures and their relations that was introduced by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in the middle of the 20th century in their foundational work on algebraic topology. Nowadays, category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics, and in some areas of computer science. In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones, that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.
A category is formed by two sorts of objects: the objects of the category, and the morphisms, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism. One often says that a morphism is an arrow that maps its source to its target. Morphisms can be composed if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one, and morphism composition has similar properties as function composition (associativity and existence of identity morphisms). Morphisms are often some sort of function, but this is not always the case. For example, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object, whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid.
The second fundamental concept of category is the concept of a functor, which plays the role of a morphism between two categories

ai_1499,"Category theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the formalization of mathematical concepts and structures in terms of ""objects"" and ""arrows"" (also known as ""morphisms""). It is a very abstract subject that is used to provide a framework for understanding and unifying various mathematical concepts and structures, such as groups, rings, and topological spaces.



In category theory, an object is a fundamental mathematical concept that represents a particular entity or structure. For example, in the category of groups, the objects are groups and the arrows are group homomorphisms. In the category of topological spaces, the objects are topological spaces and the arrows are continuous functions.



The main idea behind category theory is to study the relationships between these objects and the arrows that connect them, rather than the objects and arrows themselves. This allows for a more general and abstract approach to understanding mathematical concepts and structures, and enables the development of new mathematical insights and results.



Category theory has applications in a wide range of areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, topology, and logic, as well as in computer science and physics. It is a highly technical subject that requires a strong foundation in mathematics and abstract thinking, and is often studied at the graduate level.",1

ai_1501,"Domain theory is a branch of mathematical logic and computer science that studies the structure and properties of abstract domains, which are sets equipped with a partial order that generalizes the concept of a set equipped with a total order. Abstract domains are used to represent the computational complexity of algorithms and the approximation of real numbers, among other applications.



In domain theory, the partial order is often used to represent the relation ""less than or equal to,"" and the elements of the domain are typically interpreted as computational steps or approximations of real numbers. A fundamental concept in domain theory is that of a ""directed complete partial order,"" or dcpo, which is a partial order in which every subset has a least upper bound, or ""join.""



One of the main goals of domain theory is to understand the relationship between the structure of an abstract domain and the computational complexity of algorithms that operate on it. For example, it is known that certain abstract domains, such as the domain of natural numbers equipped with the partial order ""less than or equal to,"" are very useful for representing the complexity of algorithms, because they allow for the efficient representation of algorithms that have polynomial-time complexity.



Domain theory has also been applied to the study of programming languages, where it is used to study the semantics of programming languages and the relationship between different programming languages. In this context, domain theory is used to define the meaning of programming language constructs and to study the relationship between different programming languages.



Overall, domain theory is a versatile and powerful tool for understanding the computational complexity of algorithms and the semantics of programming languages, and it has had many important applications in computer science and mathematical logic.",1

Symbolic computation can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in mathematics, including algebraic equations, differential equations, and integral equations. It can also be used to perform operations on polynomials, matrices, and other types of mathematical objects.



One of the main advantages of symbolic computation is that it can often provide more insight into the structure of a problem and the relationships between different quantities than numerical techniques can. This can be particularly useful in areas of mathematics that involve complex or abstract concepts, where it can be difficult to understand the underlying structure of the problem using numerical techniques alone.



There are a number of software programs and programming languages that are specifically designed for symbolic computation, such as Mathematica, Maple, and Maxima. These tools allow users to input algebraic expressions and equations and manipulate them symbolically to find solutions or simplify them.",1
human_1527,"Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees.

Basic questions addressed by computability theory include:
Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages.",0

It is concerned with the study of what can be computed and how efficiently it can be done.



Computability theory is related to, but distinct from, the study of algorithms and complexity theory, which deal with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving problems.



The central objects of study in computability theory are the computable functions, which are the functions that can be calculated by an algorithm. A function is said to be computable if there is a systematic procedure or algorithm for calculating its output for any given input. The study of computable functions is also known as recursive function theory.



One of the fundamental results of computability theory is the Church-Turing thesis, which states that any function that can be computed by a human using pencil and paper can also be computed by a machine. This result has been instrumental in the development of modern computers and has led to the development of the theory of computation, which is the mathematical study of algorithms and their computational complexity.



Computability theory has many applications in computer science and mathematics, including the design and analysis of algorithms, the study of formal languages and automata, and the development of theoretical foundations for computer science.

human_1533,"In computer networking, linear network coding is a program in which intermediate nodes transmit data from source nodes to sink nodes by means of linear combinations.
Linear network coding may be used to improve a network's throughput, efficiency, and scalability, as well as reducing attacks and eavesdropping.  The nodes of a network take several packets and combine for transmission. This process may be used to attain the maximum possible information flow in a network.
It has been proven that, theoretically, linear coding is enough to achieve the upper bound in multicast problems with one source. However linear coding is not sufficient in general; even for more general versions of linearity such as convolutional coding and filter-bank coding. Finding optimal coding solutions for general network problems with arbitrary demands remains an open problem.",0
ai_1534,"Linear network coding is a method of transmitting data across a network in which the intermediate nodes in the network are permitted to perform coding operations on the data they receive, rather than simply forwarding it on to the next node in the network. This can potentially increase the efficiency of the network by allowing the data to be transmitted more quickly, or by allowing the network to operate with a lower error rate.



Linear network coding is based on the idea of linear transformations, which are mathematical operations that can be performed on a set of data values to produce a new set of values. These transformations can be used to mix or combine the data in various ways, and the resulting coded data can be transmitted across the network.



The key advantage of linear network coding is that it allows intermediate nodes in the network to perform coding operations on the data they receive, rather than simply forwarding it on to the next node. This can potentially increase the capacity of the network, because it allows the data to be transmitted more efficiently. For example, if two nodes in the network are sending data to a third node, linear network coding can be used to combine the data from both nodes into a single coded message, which can then be transmitted more efficiently across the network.



Linear network coding has been used in a variety of applications, including wireless communications, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed storage systems. It has been shown to be effective in increasing the capacity and efficiency of these types of networks, and is an active area of research in computer science and networking.",1
human_1535,"Data transmission and data reception or, more broadly, data communication or digital communications is the transfer and reception of data in the form of a digital bitstream or a digitized analog signal transmitted over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication using radio spectrum, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.
Analog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.
Data transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example, a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream, for example, using pulse-code modulation or more advanced source coding schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by codec equipment.",0
ai_1536,"Data transmission is the process of transmitting digital data from one device to another over a communication channel. The data can be transmitted in various forms, such as electrical signals over a wire, electromagnetic waves over the air, or light pulses through a fiber optic cable. The data is typically transmitted in the form of bits, which are the basic units of digital data.



In order for data to be transmitted, both the sending device and the receiving device must have a means of transmitting and receiving the data. This is typically accomplished through the use of a communication protocol, which is a set of rules that govern the exchange of data between the devices. The protocol defines the format of the data, the way it is transmitted, and the error-checking and error-correction methods that are used to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data.



Data transmission can be accomplished using various types of communication channels, such as wireline channels (e.g., copper wire, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable), wireless channels (e.g., radio waves, infrared, and microwave), and satellite channels. The choice of communication channel depends on the distance between the devices, the amount of data to be transmitted, the required data rate, and the availability of the required infrastructure.

human_1545,"In logic, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a formal language consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules.
The alphabet of a formal language consists of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language. Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a word, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words or well-formed formulas. A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, which consists of its formation rules.
In computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or semantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power.

An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically.

human_1551,"In computer programming, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to every ""term"" (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Usually the terms are various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. A type system dictates the operations that can be performed on a term. For variables, the type system determines the allowed values of that term. Type systems formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. ""string"", ""array of float"", ""function returning boolean"").
Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar. The main purpose of a type system in a programming language is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs due to type errors. The given type system in question determines what constitutes a type error, but in general, the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense (validity errors). Type systems allow defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of both. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, and providing a form of documentation.",0
ai_1552,"In computer science, a type system is a set of rules that assigns a property called a ""type"" to the various constructs in a programming language, such as variables, expressions, and functions. The purpose of a type system is to reduce the likelihood of runtime type errors by ensuring that type-related rules are followed during program execution.



There are several different kinds of type systems, including static type systems and dynamic type systems. In a static type system, type checking is performed at compile time, before the program is executed. This means that type errors can be detected and fixed before the program is run. In a dynamic type system, type checking is performed at runtime, as the program is being executed. This means that type errors may not be detected until the program is run, and they may cause the program to fail at runtime.



Type systems can also vary in the degree of type safety they provide. A type-safe language is one in which type errors are not possible, or at least are very unlikely to occur. A type-unsafe language is one in which type errors are more common and may be easier to introduce into a program.



Overall, type systems are an important tool for ensuring the reliability and correctness of programs, and they are an essential part of many programming languages.",1
human_1553,"In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type (ADT) is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.
Two common classes of algebraic types are product types (i.e., tuples and records) and sum types (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions, coproduct types or variant types).
The values of a product type typically contain several values, called fields.  All values of that type have the same combination of field types.  The set of all possible values of a product type is the set-theoretic product, i.e., the Cartesian product, of the sets of all possible values of its field types.
The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called variants.  A value of a variant type is usually created with a quasi-functional entity called a constructor.  Each variant has its own constructor, which takes a specified number of arguments with specified types.  The set of all possible values of a sum type is the set-theoretic sum, i.e., the disjoint union, of the sets of all possible values of its variants. Enumerated types are a special case of sum types in which the constructors take no arguments, as exactly one value is defined for each constructor.
Values of algebraic types are analyzed with pattern matching, which identifies a value by its constructor or field names and extracts the data it contains.
Algebraic data types were introduced in Hope, a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh.",0
ai_1554,"Algebraic data types (ADTs) are a feature of functional programming languages that allow you to define custom data types by combining and extending other data types. They are called ""algebraic"" because they are defined using algebraic operations, such as sum and product.



In functional programming, data is often treated as immutable, meaning that once it is created, it cannot be modified. ADTs allow you to create new data types that can represent complex data structures in a way that is both easy to understand and easy to manipulate.



One common use of ADTs is to define data types that can represent a fixed set of values, such as a simple enumeration. For example, you might define an ADT called ""Color"" with three possible values: ""Red"", ""Green"", and ""Blue"". You could then use this ADT to create a function that takes a color as an argument and returns a different color based on some logic.



ADTs can also be used to define more complex data structures, such as trees or lists. For example, you might define an ADT called ""Tree"" that has two possible values: ""Leaf"" and ""Branch"". A ""Leaf"" value would represent a leaf node in a tree, while a ""Branch"" value would represent a branch node with one or more child nodes. You could then use this ADT to create functions that operate on trees, such as functions to traverse the tree or to search for a particular value.

While personal computer users may develop their own applications, usually these systems run commercial software, free-of-charge software (""freeware""), which is most often proprietary, or free and open-source software, which is provided in ""ready-to-run"", or binary, form. Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers. Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible. This contrasts with mobile systems, where software is often available only through a manufacturer-supported channel, and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.
Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows. Alternatives to Microsoft's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry. These include Apple's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux.

human_1561,"A Petri net, also known as a place/transition (PT) net, is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems.  It is a class of discrete event dynamic system. A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph that has two types of elements, places and transitions.  Place elements are depicted as white circles and transition elements are depicted as rectangles. 
A place can contain any number of tokens, depicted as black circles. A transition is enabled if all places connected to it as inputs contain at least one token. Some sources state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.
Like industry standards such as UML activity diagrams, Business Process Model and Notation, and event-driven process chains, Petri nets offer a graphical notation for stepwise processes that include choice, iteration, and concurrent execution. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis[citation needed].",0
ai_1562,"A Petri net is a mathematical modeling language for the description of distributed systems.

As its name indicates, the PRAM is intended as the parallel-computing analogy to the random-access machine (RAM) (not to be confused with random-access memory). In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as synchronization and communication, but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors. Algorithm cost, for instance, is estimated using two parameters O(time) and O(time × processor_number).",0
ai_1566,"A parallel random-access machine (PRAM) is an abstract model of a computer that can perform multiple operations simultaneously. It is a theoretical model that is used to study the complexity of algorithms and to design efficient parallel algorithms.



In the PRAM model, there are n processors that can communicate with each other and access a shared memory. The processors can execute instructions in parallel, and the memory can be accessed randomly by any processor at any time. There are several variations of the PRAM model, depending on the specific assumptions made about the communication and synchronization among the processors.



One common variation of the PRAM model is the concurrent-read concurrent-write (CRCW) PRAM, in which multiple processors can read from and write to the same memory location concurrently. Another variation is the exclusive-read exclusive-write (EREW) PRAM, in which only one processor can access a memory location at a time.



PRAM algorithms are designed to take advantage of the parallelism available in the PRAM model, and they can often be implemented on real parallel computers, such as supercomputers and parallel clusters.

human_1567,"A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the message was created by a known sender (authenticity), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.
Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which includes any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. Electronic signatures have legal significance in some countries, including Canada, South Africa, the United States, Algeria, Turkey, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia,[10] Uruguay,[11] Switzerland, Chile[12] and the countries of the European Union.[13][14]
Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances, they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed sender. Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. They can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret.[15] Further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a timestamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid.[16][17] Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring: examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol.",0
ai_1568,"A digital signature is a way of verifying the authenticity and integrity of a digital document or message. It is a cryptographic method that uses a private key to create a unique signature for a document, and a public key to verify the signature.



Digital signatures are commonly used to secure electronic communications, such as emails, and to authenticate the identity of the sender. They can also be used to verify the authenticity of digital documents, such as contracts, invoices, and legal documents.



To create a digital signature, the sender uses a digital certificate, which contains their public and private keys, to apply a unique code to the document. The private key is used to create the signature, and the public key is used to verify it. When the document is received, the recipient can use the sender's public key to verify the signature and confirm that the document has not been tampered with.

Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.",0
ai_1570,"A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. The main property of a cryptographic hash function is that it is computationally infeasible to find two different input messages that produce the same hash output. This makes it a useful tool for verifying the integrity of a message or data file, as any changes to the input will result in a different hash output.



Cryptographic hash functions are also known as 'digest functions' or 'one-way functions', as it is easy to compute the hash of a message, but it is very difficult to recreate the original message from its hash. This makes them useful for storing passwords, as the original password cannot be easily determined from the stored hash.



Some examples of cryptographic hash functions include SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm), MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5), and RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest).",1
human_1571,"In cryptography, a key-agreement protocol is a protocol whereby two or more parties can agree on a key in such a way that both influence the outcome. If properly done, this precludes undesired third parties from forcing a key choice on the agreeing parties. Protocols that are useful in practice also do not reveal to any eavesdropping party what key has been agreed upon.
Many key exchange systems have one party generate the key, and simply send that key to the other party—the other party has no influence on the key.
Using a key-agreement protocol avoids some of the key distribution problems associated with such systems.
Protocols where both parties influence the final derived key are the only way to implement perfect forward secrecy.",0
ai_1572,"A key-agreement protocol is a type of cryptographic protocol that allows two or more parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. The shared secret key can then be used to secure subsequent communications between the parties using symmetric-key encryption.



Key-agreement protocols typically involve the exchange of messages between the parties to establish the shared secret key. These protocols often rely on the use of public-key cryptography, in which each party has a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt messages, while the private key is used to decrypt them.



One well-known example of a key-agreement protocol is Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In this protocol, two parties (Alice and Bob) can establish a shared secret key by exchanging messages that contain their public keys and some additional information. The shared secret key is then derived from the public keys and the additional information using a mathematical function.



Other examples of key-agreement protocols include Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), Secure Remote Password (SRP), and Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE).



Key-agreement protocols are widely used in modern communication systems to establish secure channels for the exchange of sensitive information.",1
human_1573,"In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.
If proving a statement requires that the prover possess some secret information, then the verifier will not be able to prove the statement to anyone else without possessing the secret information. The statement being proved must include the assertion that the prover has such knowledge, but without including or transmitting the knowledge itself in the assertion. Otherwise, the statement would not be proved in zero-knowledge because it provides the verifier with additional information about the statement by the end of the protocol. A zero-knowledge proof of knowledge is a special case when the statement consists only of the fact that the prover possesses the secret information.
Interactive zero-knowledge proofs require interaction between the individual (or computer system) proving their knowledge and the individual validating the proof.
A protocol implementing zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge must necessarily require interactive input from the verifier. This interactive input is usually in the form of one or more challenges such that the responses from the prover will convince the verifier if and only if the statement is true, i.e., if the prover does possess the claimed knowledge. If this were not the case, the verifier could record the execution of the protocol and replay it to convince someone else that they possess the secret information. The new party's acceptance is either justified since the replayer does possess the information (which implies that the protocol leaked information, and thus, is not proved in zero-knowledge), or the acceptance is spurious, i.e., was accepted from someone who does not actually possess the information.
Some forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs exist, but the validity of the proof relies on computational assumptions (typically the assumptions of an ideal cryptographic hash function).",0
ai_1574,"Zero-knowledge proof, or zero-knowledge protocol, is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the fact that the statement is indeed true.



In other words, a zero-knowledge proof allows one party to prove to another party that they know the solution to a problem, without actually revealing the solution itself. This is useful in situations where the prover wants to prove their knowledge or possession of certain information, but does not want to reveal the actual information to the verifier.



For example, suppose Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows the secret password to a certain system, but she doesn't want to reveal the actual password to Bob. Alice can use a zero-knowledge proof to prove to Bob that she knows the password, without revealing the password itself.



Zero-knowledge proofs are based on the idea of interactive proof systems, in which the prover and verifier engage in a back-and-forth interaction to determine the truth of a statement. Zero-knowledge proofs are considered to be a form of ""non-interactive proof,"" because they do not require the prover and verifier to exchange any information beyond a single message. This makes zero-knowledge proofs particularly useful in situations where the prover and verifier do not trust each other, or do not want to reveal any information beyond the fact that a statement is true.



Zero-knowledge proofs have many applications, including in cryptography, where they are used to prove the authenticity of digital signatures and to secure online transactions. They are also used in the field of computer science, particularly in the area of database security, where they can be used to prove the possession of certain information without revealing the actual information itself.",1

It is a technique for secure multi-party computation, which is the process of allowing two or more parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.



In a garbled circuit, each input is first encrypted using a randomly generated key. The encrypted inputs, or ""garbled inputs,"" are then passed through a series of gates, which are essentially simple Boolean functions that take one or more inputs and produce an output based on those inputs. The gates are constructed in such a way that the output of the function can be computed without revealing the inputs to any of the parties involved.



For example, suppose Alice and Bob want to compute the AND function on two inputs, but they do not want to reveal their inputs to each other. Using a garbled circuit, Alice and Bob can each encrypt their inputs and pass the encrypted inputs through the AND gate. The output of the AND gate will be the result of the AND function on the two inputs, but neither Alice nor Bob will be able to see the inputs or the output.

The relational model is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which is a set of tuples (rows) with a unique identifier (primary key).



Hierarchical model: This model stores data in a tree-like structure, with a parent-child relationship between records. Each record has a single parent record, except for the root record, which has no parent.



Network model: This model is similar to the hierarchical model, but allows multiple parent-child relationships between records.



Object-oriented model: This model stores data as objects, which are self-contained units of data and behavior. Objects are organized into classes, which define their properties and methods.

human_1587,"Video games,[a] also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.
Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.
In the 2000s, the core industry centered on ""AAA"" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s.

In general, information engineering involves the use of computer science and engineering principles to create systems that can efficiently and effectively handle large amounts of data and provide insights or support decision-making processes. This field is often interdisciplinary, and professionals in information engineering may work with teams of people with a variety of skills, including computer science, business, and information technology.



Some key tasks in information engineering include:



Developing and maintaining databases: Information engineers may design and build databases to store and manage large amounts of structured data. They may also work to optimize the performance and scalability of these systems.



Analyzing and modeling data: Information engineers may use techniques such as data mining and machine learning to uncover patterns and trends in data. They may also create data models to better understand the relationships between different pieces of data and to facilitate the processing and analysis of data.



Designing and implementing data systems: Information engineers may be responsible for designing and building systems that can handle large volumes of data and provide access to that data to users. This may involve selecting and implementing appropriate hardware and software, and designing and implementing the data architecture of the system.

The main goal of MIC is to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images. While closely related to the field of medical imaging, MIC focuses on the computational analysis of the images, not their acquisition. The methods can be grouped into several broad categories: image segmentation, image registration, image-based physiological modeling, and others.",0

human_1593,"Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech. The reverse process is speech recognition.
Synthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database. Systems differ in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores phones or diphones provides the largest output range, but may lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the vocal tract and other human voice characteristics to create a completely ""synthetic"" voice output.
The quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its similarity to the human voice and by its ability to be understood clearly. An intelligible text-to-speech program allows people with visual impairments or reading disabilities to listen to written words on a home computer. Many computer operating systems have included speech synthesizers since the early 1990s.
A text-to-speech system (or ""engine"") is composed of two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end has two major tasks. First, it converts raw text containing symbols like numbers and abbreviations into the equivalent of written-out words. This process is often called text normalization, pre-processing, or tokenization. The front-end then assigns phonetic transcriptions to each word, and divides and marks the text into prosodic units, like phrases, clauses, and sentences. The process of assigning phonetic transcriptions to words is called text-to-phoneme or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Phonetic transcriptions and prosody information together make up the symbolic linguistic representation that is output by the front-end. The back-end—often referred to as the synthesizer—then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into sound. In certain systems, this part includes the computation of the target prosody (pitch contour, phoneme durations), which is then imposed on the output speech.",0
ai_1594,"Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. It is a computer-based process that involves the use of software and algorithms to generate audio output in the form of human speech. The output can be in the form of text-to-speech (TTS), which involves generating spoken language from written text, or it can be in the form of a pre-recorded audio file that has been synthesized to sound like human speech.



Speech synthesis systems can be used for a variety of applications, including text-to-speech conversion for the visually impaired, voice-over work in the entertainment industry, and automated customer service systems. There are a number of different methods and approaches to speech synthesis, including rule-based synthesis, formant synthesis, and concatenative synthesis.



In rule-based synthesis, the system uses a set of rules to produce speech sounds based on the phonetic and prosodic structure of the input text. Formant synthesis involves the use of a synthesized voice that has been pre-recorded with a set of formants, or frequency bands, that represent the different sounds in a language. Concatenative synthesis involves the use of pre-recorded speech segments that are stitched together to form the desired output.



Overall, speech synthesis technology has come a long way in recent years, and the quality of synthesized speech has greatly improved. However, there is still room for further development, and research continues in this area.",1
human_1595,"A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors. As a result, it manages to reduce the complexity of computing the DFT from

 is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where N may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.
Fast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805. In 1994, Gilbert Strang described the FFT as ""the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime"", and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the IEEE magazine Computing in Science & Engineering.
The best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the factorization of N, but there are FFTs with O(N log N) complexity for all N, even for prime N. Many FFT algorithms depend only on the fact that

 is an N-th primitive root of unity, and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any finite field, such as number-theoretic transforms. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/N factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.",0
ai_1596,"The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm for efficiently computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse. The DFT is a mathematical operation that transforms a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency.



The FFT is a fast and efficient algorithm for computing the DFT and is widely used in many applications, such as signal processing, image processing, and data analysis. It is based on the idea of decomposing a sequence into a sum of sinusoids, each with a different frequency and phase. The FFT takes advantage of the symmetry and periodicity properties of the DFT to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm from O(N^2) to O(N log N), where N is the length of the sequence. This makes it much faster than naive methods for computing the DFT, such as the direct computation of the DFT using the definition, which has a complexity of O(N^2).



There are several different algorithms for computing the FFT, including the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, the Bluestein's algorithm, and the Prime Factor algorithm. Each of these algorithms has its own advantages and disadvantages and is best suited for different types of sequences and applications.",1

In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiments, which are the traditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers. Scientists and engineers develop computer programs and application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters.

Scientific models can take many different forms, such as mathematical equations, computer simulations, physical prototypes, or conceptual diagrams. They can be used to study a wide range of systems and phenomena, including physical, chemical, biological, and social systems.



The process of scientific modeling typically involves several steps, including identifying the system or phenomenon being studied, determining the relevant variables and their relationships, and constructing a model that represents these variables and relationships.

Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation.
Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these practical disciplines—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as flow velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of space and time.

human_1603,"Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under test by validation and verification. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include, but not necessarily limited to:
Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and risk of its failure to users or sponsors.
Software testing can determine the correctness of software under the assumption of some specific hypotheses (see the hierarchy of testing difficulty below), testing cannot identify all the failures within the software. Instead, it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior of the product against test oracles — principles or mechanisms by which someone might recognize a problem. These oracles may include (but are not limited to) specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, applicable laws, or other criteria.
A primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected. Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions, but only that it does not function properly under specific conditions. The scope of software testing may include the examination of code as well as the execution of that code in various environments and conditions as well as examining the aspects of code: does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do. In the current culture of software development, a testing organization may be separate from the development team. There are various roles for testing team members. Information derived from software testing may be used to correct the process by which software is developed.: 41–43 
Every software product has a target audience. For example, the audience for video game software is completely different from banking software.

human_1607,"In software development, technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt) is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
Analogous with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate ""interest"", making it harder to implement changes. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy and cost of further rework. Similarly to monetary debt, technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g. as a proof-of-concept) is required to move projects forward. On the other hand, some experts claim that the ""technical debt"" metaphor tends to minimize the ramifications, which results in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.
As a change is started on a codebase, there is often the need to make other coordinated changes in other parts of the codebase or documentation. Changes required that are not completed are considered debt, and until paid, will incur interest on top of interest, making it cumbersome to build a project. Although the term is primarily used in software development, it can also be applied to other professions.",0
ai_1608,"Technical debt is a concept that refers to the cost of maintaining and updating a software system or application. It is a metaphor that compares the cost of technical work to financial debt.

Technical debt can be incurred in a number of ways, including:



Using shortcuts or quick fixes to solve problems in the code

Failing to refactor or clean up code as it is developed

Skipping testing or other quality assurance processes

Using outdated or deprecated technologies

Failing to properly document code or systems

Managing technical debt is an important part of maintaining a healthy and efficient software development process. If technical debt is not properly managed, it can lead to increased maintenance costs and a decrease in the overall quality of the system. It can also make it more difficult to add new features or make changes to the system in the future.",1

There are several different approaches to software development, each with its own set of activities and procedures. Some common approaches include the Waterfall model, the Agile method, and the Spiral model.



In the Waterfall model, the development process is linear and sequential, with each phase building upon the previous one. This means that the requirements must be fully defined before the design phase begins, and the design must be complete before the implementation phase can begin. This approach is well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear sense of what the final product should look like.



The Agile method is a flexible, iterative approach that emphasizes rapid prototyping and ongoing collaboration between development teams and stakeholders. Agile teams work in short cycles called ""sprints,"" which allow them to rapidly develop and deliver working software.



The Spiral model is a hybrid approach that combines elements of both the Waterfall model and the Agile method. It involves a series of iterative cycles, each of which includes the activities of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. This approach is well-suited for projects with high levels of uncertainty or complexity.

In batch processing, a group of transactions or data is collected and processed at the same time, rather than processing each transaction or data individually. This can be more efficient because it allows the computer to process all of the transactions or data in a single run, rather than having to stop and start for each individual transaction or data item.

ai_1620,"""O level"" refers to the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level, which is a qualification that was formerly offered in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The GCE O Level was a subject-based qualification, typically taken by students in the age range of 14 to 16, and was equivalent to the Standard Grade or Intermediate examinations in Scotland, and to the Junior Certificate in Ireland. The GCE O Level was replaced by the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) in 1988, which is now offered by the University of Cambridge International Examinations.",1
human_1621,"The A-Level (Advanced Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education, as well as a school leaving qualification offered by the educational bodies in the United Kingdom and the educational authorities of British Crown dependencies to students completing secondary or pre-university education. They were introduced in England and Wales in 1951 to replace the Higher School Certificate.
A number of Commonwealth countries have developed qualifications with the same name as and a similar format to the British A Levels. Obtaining an A Level, or equivalent qualifications, is generally required across the board for university entrance, with universities granting offers based on grades achieved. Particularly in Singapore, its A level examinations have been regarded as being much more challenging than the United Kingdom, with most universities offering lower entry qualifications with regard to grades achieved on a Singaporean A level certificate.
A Levels are typically worked towards over two years. Normally, students take three or four A Level courses in their first year of sixth form, and most taking four cut back to three in their second year.[10] This is because university offers are normally based on three A Level grades, and taking a fourth can have an impact on grades. Unlike other level-3 qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate, A Levels have no specific subject requirements, so students have the opportunity to combine any subjects they wish to take. However, students normally pick their courses based on the degree they wish to pursue at university: most degrees require specific A Levels for entry.[11]
In legacy modular courses (last assessment Summer 2019), A Levels are split into two parts, with students within their first year of study pursuing an Advanced Subsidiary qualification, commonly referred to as an AS or AS Level, which can either serve as an independent qualification or contribute 40% of the marks towards a full A Level award. The second part is known as an A2 or A2 Level, which is generally more in-depth and academically rigorous than the AS. The AS and A2 marks are combined for a full A Level award. The A2 Level is not a qualification on its own, and must be accompanied with an AS Level in the same subject for certification.[12]",0
ai_1622,"A level, or Advanced level, is a qualification in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands that is typically studied by students during the ages of 16-18. A levels are offered in a wide range of subjects, including math, science, English, history, and languages. A levels are recognized by universities and employers as a benchmark of academic ability, and are often a requirement for admission to university in the UK.



A levels are divided into two parts: AS (Advanced Subsidiary) level and A2 level. AS levels are typically studied in the first year of the A level program, and cover about half the material of the full A level course. A2 level exams are typically taken at the end of the second year of study.



A levels are graded on a scale from A* to E, with A* being the highest grade and E being the lowest. A* and A grades are generally considered to be very good, while B, C, and D grades are considered to be good. An E grade is considered to be a pass, but is not typically considered to be a strong performance.



In addition to traditional A levels, students may also be able to take other qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the Cambridge Pre-U, which are also recognized by universities as a means of gaining admission.",1
