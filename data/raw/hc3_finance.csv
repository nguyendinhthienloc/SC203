ai_1,"Historical price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for small-cap and large-cap stocks can vary significantly over time and may not be directly comparable due to the different characteristics of these two categories of stocks.Small-cap stocks, which are defined as stocks with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion, tend to be riskier and more volatile than large-cap stocks, which have a market capitalization of $10 billion or more. As a result, investors may be willing to pay a higher price for the potential growth opportunities offered by small-cap stocks, which can lead to higher P/E ratios.On the other hand, large-cap stocks tend to be more established and stable, with a longer track record of earnings and revenue growth. As a result, these stocks may trade at lower P/E ratios, as investors may be less willing to pay a premium for their growth potential.It is important to note that P/E ratios are just one factor to consider when evaluating a stock and should not be used in isolation. Other factors, such as the company's financial health, industry trends, and macroeconomic conditions, can also impact a stock's P/E ratio.",1
human_2,"I know this question has a lot of answers already, but I feel the answers are phrased either strongly against, or mildly for, co-signing. What it amounts down to is that this is a personal choice. You cannot receive reliable information as to whether or not co-signing this loan is a good move due to lack of information. The person involved is going to know the person they would be co-signing for, and the people on this site will only have their own personal preferences of experiences to draw from. You know if they are reliable, if they will be able to pay off the loan without need for the banks to come after you.  This site can offer general theories, but I think it should be kept in mind that this is wholly a personal decision for the person involved, and them alone to make based on the facts that they know and we do not.",0
ai_3,"Co-signing a personal loan for a friend or family member can be a risky proposition. When you co-sign a loan, you are agreeing to be responsible for the loan if the borrower is unable to make the payments. This means that if your friend or family member defaults on the loan, you will be on the hook for the remaining balance.There are a few things to consider before co-signing a personal loan for someone:Do you trust the borrower to make the payments on time and in full? If you are not confident that the borrower will be able to make the payments, it may not be a good idea to co-sign the loan.Can you afford to make the payments if the borrower defaults? If you are unable to make the payments, co-signing the loan could put your own financial stability at risk.What is the purpose of the loan? If the borrower is using the loan for a risky or questionable venture, it may not be worth the risk to co-sign.Is there another way for the borrower to get the loan without a co-signer? If the borrower has a good credit score and is able to qualify for a loan on their own, it may not be necessary for you to co-sign.In general, it is important to carefully consider the risks and potential consequences before co-signing a loan for someone. If you do decide to co-sign, it is a good idea to have a conversation with the borrower about their plans for making the loan payments and to have a clear understanding of your responsibilities as a co-signer.",1

So if you credit card statement closes on the 7th pay it off on the 6th in full don't pay it when its due 2/3 weeks later. Then after three months of doing that your credit score will go up based on the fact that your debt ratio is so low.  That ratio is 30% of your credit score.  It will help quite alot.,0
ai_5,"It can be a good idea to avoid using credit cards if you are trying to improve your debt-to-income ratio. Your debt-to-income ratio is a measure of how much debt you have compared to your income. It is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. A high debt-to-income ratio can make it more difficult to qualify for a loan or mortgage, as it may indicate to lenders that you are carrying too much debt relative to your income.One way to improve your debt-to-income ratio is to pay off your credit card balances. If you are able to pay off your credit card balances, it will reduce the amount of debt you have and, in turn, improve your debt-to-income ratio. Another option is to increase your income, which will also improve your debt-to-income ratio.It is important to note that credit cards can be a useful financial tool if used responsibly. They can help you build a good credit history, earn rewards, and have a convenient way to pay for purchases. However, it is important to use credit cards wisely and only charge what you can afford to pay off each month. If you are unable to pay off your credit card balances in full each month, it can be helpful to avoid using credit cards and focus on paying off your debt.",1

ai_7,"Share split and redemption are two different corporate actions that can be taken by a company. A share split is when a company increases the number of outstanding shares by issuing more shares to existing shareholders. For example, if a company does a 2-for-1 share split, it means that each shareholder will receive an additional share for each share they own. This is done to make the shares more affordable and to increase the liquidity of the stock.On the other hand, share redemption is when a company buys back some of its outstanding shares from shareholders. This is done to reduce the number of outstanding shares and can be done for various reasons, such as to increase the value of the remaining shares or to free up capital.Dividend, on the other hand, is a distribution of a company's profits to its shareholders. It is paid in the form of cash, shares of stock, or other assets. Dividends are usually paid on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually.So, to summarize, a share split increases the number of shares while a share redemption reduces the number of shares, and a dividend is a distribution of profits to shareholders.",1

human_9,"The main disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for the interest-only loan. It's higher risk to the bank, since the principal outstanding is higher for longer.  According to the New York Times, ""Interest rates are usually an eighth- to a half-percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans."" They're also tougher to qualify for, and fewer lenders offer them, again due to the risk to the bank. Since you can always put extra towards the principal, strictly speaking, these are the only  downsides. The upside, of course, is that you can make a lower payment each month. The question is what are you doing with this? If this is the only way you can afford the payments, there's a good chance the house is too expensive for you. You're not building equity in the home, and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down. If you're using the money for other things, or you have variable income, it might be a different story. For the former, reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason, if you're cognizant of the risks. For the latter, salespeople on commission, or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses, can benefit from the flexibility.",0
ai_10,"An interest-only loan is a type of loan in which the borrower pays only the interest on the loan for a certain period of time, rather than paying down any of the principal balance. After the interest-only period ends, the borrower must start paying down the principal in addition to the interest.Here are some pros and cons of interest-only loans:Pros:Lower monthly payments: Because the borrower is only paying the interest on the loan during the interest-only period, the monthly payments are typically lower than they would be with a traditional loan. This can make it easier for the borrower to afford the loan.Flexibility: Interest-only loans can provide flexibility to borrowers who expect their income to increase in the future. For example, if a borrower expects to receive a raise or promotion in the near future, they may choose an interest-only loan so that they can afford the lower payments in the short term.Investment opportunities: Some borrowers choose interest-only loans so that they can use their extra cash to invest in other opportunities, such as real estate or stocks.Cons:Higher overall costs: Because the borrower is not paying down any of the principal balance during the interest-only period, the overall cost of the loan will be higher than it would be with a traditional loan.Risk of payment shock: When the interest-only period ends, the borrower must start paying down the principal in addition to the interest. This can lead to a significant increase in the monthly payments, which is known as ""payment shock."" This can be a burden for borrowers who are not prepared for the higher payments.Limited availability: Interest-only loans are not as widely available as traditional loans, and they may be more difficult to qualify for.Overall, it's important to carefully consider the pros and cons of an interest-only loan before deciding whether it's the right choice for you. You should also make sure to understand the terms of the loan and how your payments will change over time.

ai_21,"The size of your down payment on a house will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of the home, the type of mortgage you are obtaining, and your personal financial situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:Conventional wisdom suggests that you should aim for a down payment of at least 20% of the purchase price of the home. This is because mortgage lenders typically require a down payment of at least 20% in order to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on your loan. PMI can add significantly to your monthly mortgage payments, so avoiding it can save you a significant amount of money over the life of your loan.However, it is possible to obtain a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20%. Many lenders offer programs that allow you to put down as little as 3% or even 0% in some cases. These loans typically come with higher interest rates and may require you to pay PMI, so they may not be the best option if you have the means to make a larger down payment.In addition to the size of your down payment, you should also consider other factors such as your overall financial situation, your ability to save for a down payment, and your long-term financial goals. It may be worth saving up for a larger down payment if it means you can get a lower interest rate on your mortgage, or if it means you will have more equity in your home. On the other hand, if you have the opportunity to buy a home with a smaller down payment and it makes sense for your financial situation, it may be worth considering.Ultimately, the size of your down payment will depend on your personal financial circumstances and your long-term financial goals.

In addition to the 401(k) at work, you have a solo-401(k) for your consulting business.  You can contribute $18,000 on the employee side across the two 401(k) plans however you wish.  You can also contribute profit sharing up to 20% of compensation in your solo 401(k) plan.  However, the profit sharing limit aggregates across all plans for your consulting business.  If you max that out in your solo 401(k), then you cannot contribute to the SEP IRA. In other words, the solo 401(k) dominates the SEP IRA in terms of contributions and shares a limit on the profit-sharing contribution.

ai_35,"It's generally a good idea to have multiple retirement savings accounts, as it can help you diversify your investments and potentially increase your overall retirement savings. Having two 401(k) accounts and a SEP-IRA can be a good way to save for retirement, depending on your specific financial situation and goals.A 401(k) is a type of retirement savings plan offered by many employers. It allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax-deferred basis, meaning that the contributions are made with pre-tax dollars and are not subject to income tax until they are withdrawn in retirement. Employers may also contribute to their employees' 401(k) accounts, typically in the form of matching contributions.A SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account) is a type of retirement savings account that is available to self-employed individuals and small business owners. It works similarly to a traditional IRA, in that contributions are made on a tax-deferred basis and can potentially be deducted from your income tax return. However, unlike a traditional IRA, a SEP-IRA allows for much higher contribution limits, making it a good option for self-employed individuals who want to save a significant amount for retirement.It's important to carefully consider the terms of each retirement savings account, including the contribution limits, investment options, and fees, in order to choose the options that best meet your needs. It may also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine the best strategy for saving for retirement.",1
human_36,"An option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy (or sell) the underlying so you don't have to exercise you can just let the option expire (so long it doesn't have an automatic expiry). After expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover. Option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays. An option has two values associated with it; time value and exercise value. Far out of the money (when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side) options only have time value whereas deep in the money options (as yours seems to be) has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy (sell) at a low (high) price and then sell (buy) the underlying.  The time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move (further) in your favour and make you more money at expiry. As expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no revaluing. Up to now what I have said applies to both OTC and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading; because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower. On the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price, on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds. If these are European style options (which sounds likely) and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money. Their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money. They have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying. If I am not correct in my excise style assumption (European) I may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money.",0

Short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is based on your tax bracket.If you held the asset for more than one year before selling it, the gain is considered a long-term capital gain. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains and ordinary income.

These requirements can increase the cost of insurance for employers, which may be passed on to employees in the form of higher premiums.Second, the ACA introduced a number of taxes and fees that apply to employer-provided health insurance. These fees can also increase the cost of insurance for employers and may be passed on to employees through higher premiums.Finally, the ACA created the health insurance marketplace, where individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance. The ACA's subsidies and premium tax credits, which are available to some individuals and small businesses, can make purchasing insurance through the marketplace more affordable. This may lead some employers to shift their employees to the marketplace, which could result in higher premiums for those employees.Overall, the ACA has had a complex effect on employer-provided health insurance premiums, and the impact on any particular employer or employee will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific features of their insurance plan and the subsidies and tax credits available to them.",1

human_47,"I have a colleague who always leases cars first.  He's very well off, has piles of money in savings, owns a home, and the cherry on top, he could just write a check for the car....   He sees the lease as an insurance policy on the first couple of years of the car's life.  If it gets in an accident or he finds something about it he doesn't like, he can give it back to the dealer at the end of the term with no hassle and move on to the next car.  Some people value the fact that a lease is a rental.   If you're leasing a luxury car or something you couldn't otherwise afford, no amount of mental gymnastics will turn this in to a good idea.   Separately, you should never make a down payment on a lease.  If the car is totaled early on, you will not recoupe the money you put down.  The issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different.  If the leased car is totaled, the bank gets its money back from an insurer.  If that payment doesn't cover the value of the car, the GAP insurance will cover it.  In either situation, if there's an excess remaining it will be returned to you.  The issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment.  If you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you couldn't just simply choose to lease a used car; like you could in the case of a purchase.  Additionally, GAP is generally included in a lease whether you want it or not.  As far as I'm concerned it doesn't make financial sense to mitigate the value of the GAP coverage once you've decided to live in a lease situation.",0
ai_48,"Leasing a car can be an attractive option for some people because it allows them to drive a new car without committing to a long-term loan or paying the full purchase price upfront. When you lease a car, you are essentially paying for the use of the car for a certain period of time, usually two to four years. At the end of the lease, you have the option to purchase the car for a predetermined price, return the car to the leasing company, or lease a new car.Here are some things to consider when leasing a car that you intend to buy:Down payment: Most leasing companies will require a down payment, which is a percentage of the car's value that you pay upfront. The down payment can be used to lower your monthly payments, but it will not be applied to the purchase price of the car if you decide to buy it at the end of the lease.Mileage limits: Leasing contracts often have mileage limits, which means you are only allowed to drive the car a certain number of miles per year. If you exceed the mileage limit, you may be charged a fee for each additional mile. This can be an issue if you plan to drive the car a lot or if you are unsure how much you will be driving.Maintenance: When you lease a car, you are responsible for maintaining it in good condition. This includes regular oil changes, tire rotations, and other routine maintenance. If the car is not well-maintained, you may be charged a fee when you return it at the end of the lease.Purchase price: If you decide to purchase the car at the end of the lease, you will need to pay the predetermined purchase price. This price is often higher than the fair market value of the car, so it's important to consider whether it's worth it to buy the car or if you would be better off leasing a new car or purchasing a used car instead.Overall, leasing a car can be a good option if you want to drive a new car without committing to a long-term loan, but it's important to carefully consider the terms of the lease and whether it's the best option for you.",1

ai_56,"Purchasing a home is a significant financial commitment, and it can be intimidating for first-time home buyers who may not be familiar with all the terms and options involved. Here is a brief overview of some key concepts that you may encounter when buying a home:Down payment: A down payment is the amount of money that you put towards the purchase of a home. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the home's purchase price. For example, if you are buying a home for $200,000 and you put down 20%, your down payment would be $40,000. Down payments are typically required for most types of mortgage loans, and the size of your down payment can affect the terms of your mortgage.Private mortgage insurance (PMI): PMI is a type of insurance that is often required for home buyers who make a down payment of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. PMI protects the lender in the event that you default on your mortgage payments. The cost of PMI is typically added to your monthly mortgage payments, and it can be removed once you have built up enough equity in your home.Points: Points are a type of fee that you may be required to pay at closing when you take out a mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the mortgage loan amount. Points are typically used to buy down the interest rate on a mortgage, which can lower your monthly payments. However, the decision to pay points is a trade-off, as you may pay more up front in exchange for lower monthly payments over the life of the loan.It's important to carefully consider all of these factors when buying a home, and to consult with a financial professional to determine the best options for your specific situation.",1

It is usually expressed as a percentage of the total purchase price. Most lenders require a down payment of at least 3% of the purchase price, although some may require a higher percentage. In some cases, you may be able to qualify for a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 3.5% if you meet certain criteria, such as being a first-time homebuyer or being a veteran.Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of insurance that protects the lender in case you default on your mortgage. It is required if you put down less than 20% of the purchase price as a down payment. PMI is typically paid as a monthly premium, and the cost is based on the size of your mortgage and the amount of your down payment.Points:Points are fees that you pay to the lender at closing in exchange for a lower interest rate on your mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. For example, if you are taking out a $200,000 mortgage and you pay two points, you will pay $4,000 in points at closing. Points can be a good option if you plan to stay in your home for a long time and you want to save on interest payments over the life of the loan. However, they may not make sense if you plan to sell the home or refinance within a few years, as you may not recoup the cost of the points.It's important to consider all of these factors when deciding how much to put down as a down payment and whether to pay points or PMI.

(See this article for the mexican case, the introduction has a list of other articles you could read on the subject). In some cases parity doesn't seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative & legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but don't impact the ADR holder (since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs). It's also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly: the law of one price doesn't apply for very short time-frames, just that if you're not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you won't see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU won't be able to take advantage of it (In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average half-life of ~3 days). Some price divergence might be expected: ADR holders shouldn't be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence.

The price of an ADR is based on the price of the underlying foreign stock, as well as supply and demand for the ADR itself. The price of an ADR may also be affected by various market factors, such as the performance of the foreign company, the state of the global economy, and the strength of the U.S. dollar.ADRs are typically issued in the U.S. by banks or other financial institutions, which act as depositaries. These depositaries hold the underlying foreign shares and issue ADRs to represent them. The ADRs are then listed on a U.S. stock exchange and traded just like regular U.S. stocks.There are two main types of ADRs: sponsored and unsponsored. Sponsored ADRs are issued by the foreign company itself and are typically easier to trade because the company is involved in the process.

human_63,"I believe your statement is mostly correct:  ...all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource-poor. When you purchase a $50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $3, most people turn it down, not only because they don't think it's worth it, but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3, they don't worry enough about that $50 to care if they have to buy a new one, or live without it. The percentage of your net worth also matters. For example, if you had an entire loss tomorrow, you'd be out $20K if you needed to re-purchase your possessions. (30K minus 10K in current coverage.) $20K is approximately 1/44 or 2.3% of your net worth. If a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3% of your net worth, some might consider that lucky, so from that point of view it isn't really a big deal. But on the flip side, if the extra insurance only costs you $50 more per year, you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either. I think for most people, the value of items in their home may be their net worth, or at least a much larger percentage of it, in which case the insurance makes more sense.

ai_64,"Self-insuring means that you are taking on the risk of financial loss yourself, rather than transferring that risk to an insurance company through a policy. It can be a good idea to self-insure for smaller losses that you can easily afford to pay out of pocket, but it is generally not a good idea to self-insure for large losses or disasters, such as a fire or a natural disaster, as the financial impact of these events can be significant and difficult to recover from.Renter's insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for your personal property and liability in the event of a loss, such as theft, fire, or water damage. It can also provide coverage for additional living expenses if you are unable to live in your rental due to a covered loss. Renter's insurance is typically relatively inexpensive and can provide valuable protection for your personal property and financial well-being.In general, it is a good idea to have some level of renter's insurance to protect against potential losses, even if you are able to self-insure for smaller losses. It is important to carefully consider your individual circumstances and the level of coverage that is appropriate for your needs. You may want to consider speaking with an insurance agent or financial advisor to help you determine the right amount of coverage for your situation.",1
human_65,"The best answer to this is: Read the fine print on your credit card agreement. What is common, at least in the US, is that you can make any charges you want during a time window.  When the date comes around that your statement balance is calculated, you will owe interest on any amount that is showing up as outstanding in your account.  Example...  To revise the example you gave, let's say Jan 1. your account balance was $0. Jan. 3rd you went out and spent $1,000.  Your account statement will be prepared every XX days... usually 30. So if your last statement was Dec. 27th, you can expect your next statement to be prepared ~Jan.24 or Jan. 27.  To be safe, (i.e. not accrue any interest charges) you will want to make sure that your balance shows $0 when your statement is next prepared.  So back to the example you gave--if your balance showed $1,000... and you paid it off, but then charged $2,000 to it... so that there was now a new set of $2,000 charges in your account, then the bank would begin charging you interest when your next statement was prepared.  Note that there are some cards that give you a certain number of days to pay off charges before accruing interest... it just goes back to my saying ""the best answer is read the fine print on your card agreement.""",0
ai_66,"If you have a credit card with a balance that exceeds your credit limit, you may be charged an over-limit fee by your credit card issuer. In addition to the over-limit fee, you may also be charged interest on any amount that you charge to your credit card that exceeds your credit limit. The interest rate on this type of balance is typically higher than the interest rate on your regular credit card balance.It's important to keep your credit card balance within your credit limit to avoid over-limit fees and high interest charges. If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card or if you are consistently carrying a balance that exceeds your credit limit, you may want to consider contacting your credit card issuer to discuss your options. They may be able to work with you to lower your interest rate or to develop a payment plan to help you pay off your balance.",1
human_67,"We face the same issue here in Switzerland. My background: Institutional investment management, currency risk management. My thoughs are: Home Bias is the core concept of your quesiton. You will find many research papers on this topic. The main problems with a high home bias is that the investment universe in your small local investment market is usually geared toward your coutries large corporations. Lack of diversification: In your case: the ASX top 4 are all financials, actually banks, making up almost 25% of the index. I would expect the bond market to be similarly concentrated but I dont know. In a portfolio context, this is certainly a negative. Liquidity: A smaller economy obviously has less large corporations when compared globally (check wikipedia / List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization) thereby offering lower liquidity and a smaller investment universe. Currency Risk: I like your point on not taking a stance on FX. This simplifies the task to find a hedge ratio that minimises portfolio volatility when investing internationally and dealing with currencies. For equities, you would usually find that a hedge ratio anywhere from 0-30% is effective and for bonds one that ranges from 80-100%. The reason is that in an equity portfolio, currency risk contributes less to overall volatility than in a bond portfolio. Therefore you will need to hedge less to achieve the lowest possible risk. Interestingly, from a global perspective, we find, that the AUD is a special case whereby, if you hedge the AUD you actually increase total portfolio risk. Maybe it has to do with the AUD being used in carry trades a lot, but that is a wild guess. Hedged share classes: You could buy the currency hedged shared classes of investment funds to invest globally without taking currency risks. Be careful to read exactly what and how the share class implements its currency hedging though.",0
ai_68,"The best way for residents of smaller economies to allocate their portfolio between domestic and foreign assets will depend on their individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Some factors to consider when making this decision include the potential returns, risks, and diversification benefits of each asset class, as well as the investor's ability to handle currency exchange risk and the overall economic environment in their home country.One approach to portfolio allocation for residents of smaller economies is to diversify across both domestic and foreign assets to help spread risk and potentially increase returns. This could involve investing in a mix of domestic stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, as well as foreign stocks, bonds, and other investment instruments.It's important to remember that investing in foreign assets carries additional risks, such as currency exchange risk and political risk, that may not be present in domestic investments. Investors should carefully assess these risks and consider the impact they may have on their portfolio.It's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional or advisor to help assess the risks and potential returns of different investment options and to develop a portfolio allocation strategy that is tailored to the individual's financial situation and goals.",1
human_69,"My view is from the Netherlands, a EU country. Con: Credit cards are more risky. If someone finds your card, they can use it for online purchases without knowing any PIN, just by entering the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back. Worse, sometimes that information is stored in databases, and those get stolen by hackers! Also, you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them, stopped using the service, and be surprised about the charge later. Debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your PIN to do online payments (the ones I have in the Netherlands do, anyway), and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones. Con: Banks get a percentage of each credit card payment. Unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction (of, say, half a cent), credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more, a significant part of the profit margin. I feel this is just wrong. Con: automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment With debit cards, the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money isn't there, you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way (credit card after all, other bank account, cash, etc). When a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently, someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money wasn't there. So I had to pay interest, on something I bought weeks ago... Pro: Credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance. I've never used this and don't know how it works, but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges. Pro: Credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases I don't know how it is with Visa or MC-issued debit cards, but many US sites accept only cards that have number/expiration date/security code and thus my normal bank account debit card isn't useable. Conclusion: definitely have one, but only use it when absolutely necessary.",0

However, there are some situations where a credit card may be more convenient or necessary:Emergencies: If you don't have enough money in your checking or savings account to cover an emergency expense, a credit card can be a useful backup.Travel: Some hotels and rental car companies may require a credit card to hold as a deposit, even if you are paying with a debit card.Rewards: Some credit cards offer rewards or other benefits (such as cash back or points) for using the card, which may be more valuable than any rewards offered by your debit card.Online shopping: Some online merchants may require a credit card as a form of payment, even if they also accept debit cards.Building credit: Using a credit card responsibly and paying off the balance in full each month can help you build a positive credit history, which can be beneficial when you apply for loans or other financial products in the future.Overall, whether or not you need a credit card in addition to your debit card will depend on your individual financial situation and needs.

Semi related question (answers have some good info) -  Construction loan for new house replacing existing mortgaged house?",0
ai_72,"If you are considering tearing down an existing house and building a new one, there are several mortgage loan implications to consider.First, you will need to obtain financing for the construction of the new house. This can typically be done through a construction loan, which is a short-term loan that provides funds to cover the cost of building the new house. Construction loans typically require a down payment of at least 20% of the total cost of the project, and the loan is typically paid off once the construction is complete and the house is sold or refinanced.It's important to note that construction loans can be more expensive and have higher interest rates than traditional mortgages, as they involve a higher level of risk for the lender. You may also be required to have a higher credit score and a higher debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a construction loan.In addition to obtaining financing for the construction of the new house, you will also need to consider the financing for the land on which the new house will be built. If you already own the land, you may be able to use the equity in the land as collateral for the construction loan. If you need to purchase the land, you will need to obtain a separate mortgage loan to finance the purchase.Finally, it's important to consider the tax implications of tearing down an existing house and building a new one. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to claim certain tax deductions or credits for the construction of the new house, such as the cost of materials, labor, and design fees. You should consult with a tax professional to determine what tax implications apply in your situation.",1

human_80,"Knowing the answer to this question is generally not as useful as it may seem.  The stock's current price is the consensus of thousands of people who are looking at the many relevant factors (dividend rate, growth prospects, volatility, risk, industry, etc.) that determine its value.  A stock's price is the market's valuation of the cash flows it entitles you to in the future.  Researching a stock's value means trying to figure out if there is something relevant to these cash flows that the market doesn't know about or has misjudged.  Pretty much anything we can list for you here that will affect a stock's price is something the market knows about, so it's not likely to help you know if something is mispriced.  Therefore it's not useful to you. If you are not a true expert on how important the relevant factors are and how the market is reacting to them currently (and often even if you are), then you are essentially guessing.  How likely are you to catch something that the thousands of other investors have missed and how likely are you to miss something that other investors have understood?

One important factor is the time value of money, which means that the value of money decreases over time due to inflation. This means that $4,000 today may be worth more than the same amount in the future due to the impact of inflation.Another factor to consider is the opportunity cost of the money.

This includes:Federal income tax: LLCs are taxed at the federal level on their profits, just like other businesses. The tax rate will depend on the LLC's income and the number of owners (known as ""members"").State income tax: Georgia does not have a state income tax, so LLCs are not required to pay state income tax on their profits.Sales tax: If your LLC sells goods or services that are subject to sales tax, you'll need to collect and remit the tax to the state.Self-employment tax: If you are the only owner of your LLC and you receive income from the LLC, you'll need to pay self-employment tax on that income. This tax is used to fund programs such as Social Security and Medicare.Employment taxes: If your LLC has employees, you'll need to pay employment taxes, including federal income tax withholding, Social Security tax, and Medicare tax.It's important to note that this is just a general overview of the taxes that may apply to your LLC.

How many years will it take to save up enough?  2? 5? 10?  You may want to review your current work position instead, so you'll make more and hopefully save more towards what you do want. Important: Be prepared for the speed bumps of life. My landlord sold the house I was renting out from under me, as I was on a month-to-month contract.  I had to have a full second deposit at the ready to put down when renting elsewhere, as well as the moving expenses.

ai_95,"There are a few options you might consider when saving for a car:High-yield savings account: This type of account usually offers a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account, so you can earn more on the money you save.Money market account: This type of account is similar to a high-yield savings account, but it may offer even higher interest rates and may have more flexible withdrawal options.Certificate of deposit (CD): With a CD, you agree to keep your money in the account for a specific amount of time (e.g., six months, one year, etc.) in exchange for a higher interest rate. CDs can be a good option if you don't need to access your money for a while and want to earn a higher rate of return.Individual retirement account (IRA): If you're saving for the long term and you're eligible to contribute to an IRA, this type of account can be a good option. There are several different types of IRAs, including traditional and Roth, and each one has its own set of rules and tax benefits.Ultimately, the best option for you will depend on your financial situation and your saving goals.

human_96,"Yes this is possible in the most liquid securities, but currently it would take several days to get filled in one contract at that amount There are also position size limits (set by the OCC and other Self Regulatory Organizations) that attempt to prevent people from cornering a market through the options market. (getting loads of contacts without effecting the price of the underlying asset, exercising those contracts and suddenly owning a huge stake of the asset and nobody saw it coming - although this is still VERY VERY possible) So for your example of an option of $1.00 per contract, then the position size limits would have prevented 100 million of those being opened (by one person/account that is). Realistically, you would spread out your orders amongst several options strike prices and expiration dates.

A key time saver is that we have a template sheet that gets copied and pasted, then modified for the current month.  Typically 90% of the stuff is the same and each month requires very little modification.  This is one of my problems with EveryDollar.  I have to enter everything each and every month. We also have separate checking accounts and responsibility for different areas of the family expenses.  Doing this risks that we act as roommates, but we both clearly understand the money in one persons account equally belongs to the other and during hard times had to make up for shortfalls on the part of the other. Also we use cash for groceries, eating out, and other day to day expenses.  So we don't have a great need to track expenses or enter transactions. That is what works for us, and it takes us very little time to manage our money.  The budget meeting normally lasts less than a half hour and that includes goal tracking.

human_104,"Currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount. This is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from - in the form of its own currency. We will continue with this analogy, if the central bank says these ""shares"" are worth $1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $0.80 and decreasing, then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg, and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank's solvency. (People will know the $1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is, because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services, especially when it comes to imports. Shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor, which happens no matter what the government's punishments are for doing so). Swiss National Bank (central bank) did this in early 2015, as it experienced volatility in the Euro which it had previously been trying to keep it's currency pegged to. It became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own. The central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve, such as selling a lot of foreign currency X, buying more of currency Y. They can and do take losses doing this. (Swiss National Bank is maintaining a large loss) They can also flood their economy with more of their currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. People colloquially call this ""printing money"" but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools. The good and service goes onto the central bank's balance book, and the company/entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash (another reading is that the bond is as good as cash). The bond didn't previously exist until the central bank said it did, and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds. Bond monetization (also called Quantitative Easing) is practiced by the Federal Reserve in the United States, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and now the Central Bank of the Republic of China",0

One way is for the central bank of the country to sell its own currency in the foreign exchange market and buy foreign currencies in exchange. This can lead to a decrease in the supply of the domestic currency and an increase in the demand for foreign currencies, which can cause the value of the domestic currency to decrease relative to the foreign currencies.Another way that a country can devalue its currency is by changing the exchange rate regime it uses. For example, if a country is using a fixed exchange rate system and the value of its currency is no longer sustainable, the central bank may decide to switch to a floating exchange rate system, which allows the market to determine the value of the currency. This can also lead to a decrease in the value of the currency.Finally, a country may devalue its currency by implementing economic policies that lead to inflation.

human_107,"Is it not that bad? Depends how bad is bad. The problems causes by a government having large debt are similar to those caused by an individual having large debt. The big issue is: More and more of your income goes to paying interest on the debt, and is thus not available for spending on goods and services. If it gets bad enough, you find you cannot make payments, you start defaulting on loans, and then you have to make serious sacrifices, like selling your property to pay the debt. Nations have an advantage over individuals in that they can sometimes repudiate debt, i.e. simply declare that they are not going to pay. Lenders can then refuse to give them more money, but that doesn't get their original loans paid back. In theory other nations could send in troops to seize property to pay the loan, but this is a very extreme solution. Totally aside from any moral considerations, modern warfare is very expensive, it's likely the war would cost you more than you'd recover on the debt. How much debt is too much? It's hard to give a number, any more than one could give a ""maximum acceptable debt"" for an individual.

A performance fee is a type of fee that is paid to the fund manager based on the fund's investment performance over a certain period of time.The high water mark is the highest level of net asset value (NAV) that a mutual fund has reached. When the NAV of the mutual fund exceeds the high water mark, the fund manager may be eligible to receive a performance fee. The performance fee is usually a percentage of the excess returns above the high water mark. For example, if the mutual fund's NAV exceeds the high water mark by 10%, and the performance fee is 20%, the fund manager would receive a 2% fee based on the excess returns.The purpose of the high water mark is to ensure that the fund manager is only paid a performance fee when the mutual fund generates positive returns for its investors. If the mutual fund's NAV falls below the high water mark, the fund manager is not eligible to receive a performance fee until the NAV surpasses the high water mark again. This helps to align the interests of the fund manager with those of the investors and incentivize the fund manager to generate strong returns for the mutual fund.",1

human_118,"I hope a wall of text with citations qualifies as ""relatively easy."" Many of these studies are worth quoting at length. Long story short, a great deal of research has found that actively-managed funds underperform market indexes and passively-managed funds because of their high turnover and higher fees, among other factors.  Longer answer: Chris is right in stating that survivorship bias presents a problem for such research; however, there are several academic papers that address the survivorship problem, as well as the wider subject of active vs. passive performance. I'll try to provide a brief summary of some of the relevant literature.  The seminal paper that started the debate is Michael Jensen's 1968 paper titled ""The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964"". This is the paper where Jensen's alpha, the ubiquitous measure of the performance of mutual fund managers, was first defined. Using a dataset of 115 mutual fund managers, Jensen finds that The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. Although this paper doesn't address problems of survivorship, it's notable because, among other points, it found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse even when fund expenses were ignored. Since actively-managed funds tend to have higher expenses than passive funds, the actual picture looks even worse for actively managed funds. A more recent paper on the subject, which draws similar conclusions, is Martin Gruber's 1996 paper ""Another puzzle: The growth in actively managed mutual funds"". Gruber calls it ""a puzzle"" that investors still invest in actively-managed funds, given that their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. He addresses survivorship bias by tracking funds across the entire sample, including through mergers. Since most mutual funds that disappear are merged into existing funds, he assumes that investors in a fund that disappear choose to continue investing their money in the fund that resulted from the merger. Using this assumption and standard measures of mutual fund performance, Gruber finds that mutual funds underperform an appropriately weighted average of the indices by about 65 basis points per year. Expense ratios for my sample averaged 113 basis points a year. These numbers suggest that active management adds value, but that mutual funds charge the investor more than the value added. Another nice paper is Mark Carhart's 1997 paper ""On persistence in mutual fund performance"" uses a sample free of survivorship bias because it includes ""all known equity funds over this period."" It's worth quoting parts of this paper in full: I demonstrate that expenses have at least a one-for-one negative impact on fund performance, and that turnover also negatively impacts performance. ... Trading reduces performance by approximately 0.95% of the trade's market value.  In reference to expense ratios and other fees, Carhart finds that The investment costs of expense ratios, transaction costs, and load fees all have a direct, negative impact on performance. The study also finds that funds with abnormally high returns last year usually have higher-than-expected returns next year, but not in the following years, because of momentum effects. Lest you think the news is all bad, Russ Wermer's 2000 study ""Mutual fund performance: An empirical decomposition into stock‐picking talent, style, transactions costs, and expenses"" provides an interesting result. He finds that many actively-managed mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market, even though the net return of the funds themselves underperforms passive funds and the market itself.  On a net-return level, the funds underperform broad market indexes by one percent a year. Of the 2.3% difference between the returns on stock holdings and the net returns of the funds, 0.7% per year is due to the lower average returns of the nonstock holdings of the funds during the period (relative to stocks). The remaining 1.6% per year is split almost evenly between the expense ratios and the transaction costs of the funds. The final paper I'll cite is a 2008 paper by Fama and French (of the Fama-French model covered in business schools) titled, appropriately, ""Mutual Fund Performance"". The paper is pretty technical, and somewhat above my level at this time of night, but the authors state one of their conclusions bluntly quite early on: After costs (that is, in terms of net returns to investors) active investment is a negative sum game.  Emphasis mine. In short, expense ratios, transaction costs, and other fees quickly diminish the returns to active investment. They find that The [value-weight] portfolio of mutual funds that invest primarily in U.S. equities is close to the market portfolio, and estimated before fees and expenses, its alpha is close to zero. Since the [value-weight] portfolio of funds produces an α close to zero in gross returns, the alpha estimated on the net returns to investors is negative by about the amount of fees and expenses. This implies that the higher the fees, the farther alpha decreases below zero. Since actively-managed mutual funds tend to have higher expense ratios than passively-managed index funds, it's safe to say that their net return to the investor is worse than a market index itself. I don't know of any free datasets that would allow you to research this, but one highly-regarded commercial dataset is the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago. In financial research, CRSP is one of the ""gold standards"" for historical market data, so if you can access that data (perhaps for a firm or academic institution, if you're affiliated with one that has access), it's one way you could run some numbers yourself.",0
ai_119,"There is a strong body of evidence that suggests that low expense ratio funds tend to outperform high expense ratio funds over the long term. This is because the higher fees associated with high expense ratio funds can eat into investment returns, reducing the overall performance of the fund.One way to demonstrate this relationship is to compare the returns of low expense ratio funds to those of high expense ratio funds over a long period of time, such as 10 years or more. This can be done using publicly available data from a reliable source, such as a mutual fund database or financial news website.To make the comparison more meaningful, it is important to select low expense ratio and high expense ratio funds that are similar in other ways, such as asset class, investment style, and risk level. This will help ensure that any differences in performance are due to the expense ratio rather than other factors.Once you have gathered the necessary data, you can use a tool such as a spreadsheet or charting software to create a graph or chart that illustrates the performance of the low expense ratio and high expense ratio funds over time. This can help make it easier to see the difference in performance and understand the impact of the expense ratio on fund returns.It is worth noting that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, so it is important to consider other factors in addition to expense ratio when selecting an investment. However, the evidence suggests that low expense ratio funds tend to outperform high expense ratio funds over the long term, making them a good choice for many investors.",1

Coming from Puerto Rico you might be shocked how expensive it is to live there, and also how infrequently you see the sun. Your question is highly subjective.  One person would need 100K to cover those things you are talking about, while others would need less then 30K.  Also where you live in the Seattle area makes a difference.  Will you be in Redmond or Bothell?  Housing costs vary considerably. One nice thing about that part of the country is can be very inexpensive to vacation.  A fishing license, a packed lunch, and a bit of gas is all that is necessary to really enjoy that part of the country.   Back in the day I used to ski Steven's Pass during the week, and the lift tickets were a 1/3 of the weekend rate.  Having hiking/camping gear and or a bicycle is also a good way to enjoy life. Bottom line I would make a budget, and go from there.  If you intend on retiring in PR, then you would need a lot less then if you choose to remain in Seattle so even that is subjective. Perfect Example, Marysville, which is way out of town so a commute would be a problem.  However, unlike many parts south of Seattle, it is safe and nice.  ~200K for a 1200 sq ft home.  Holy cow.

Some factors that may influence how much you should save include your age, your income level, your current debts, your expected expenses in the near future (such as the cost of buying a home or paying for a child's education), and your long-term financial goals (such as retirement).Here are a few general guidelines that may be helpful as you consider how much to save:Many financial experts recommend saving at least 20% of your income. This can help you build a solid financial foundation and ensure that you have the resources you need to meet your financial goals.If you are just starting out in your career and have a lower income, you may need to save a smaller percentage of your income. However, it is still important to start saving as soon as possible, even if it is only a small amount.If you are trying to pay off high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, you may want to save a higher percentage of your income until you have paid off this debt. This can help you get out of debt more quickly and save money on interest payments.If you are nearing retirement age and have not yet saved enough for retirement, you may need to save a higher percentage of your income to catch up.Ultimately, the best approach for you will depend on your specific financial situation and goals. It may be helpful to work with a financial advisor or to use a budgeting app or tool to help you determine how much you should be saving.",1

Indeed, if adopted by another country with similar or greater GDP, that economy could end up becoming the primary driver of the currency's value.  It may be harder to control counterfeiting. Perhaps not in the issuing country itself, but in foreign countries that do not adopt new bills as quickly.",0
ai_124,"There can be several reasons why a country might want to use the currency of another country. Here are a few possible explanations:Economic stability: Using the currency of a more stable and economically advanced country can help provide a sense of stability and security to a country's economy. This can be particularly appealing to countries that have experienced high levels of inflation or economic instability in the past.Trade: Some countries may find it more convenient to use the currency of a major trading partner in order to facilitate trade. This can help to reduce exchange rate risk and make it easier to conduct business across borders.Influence: Using the currency of another country can also be a way for a country to demonstrate its economic ties and alignment with that country. This can be particularly important for countries that want to maintain close economic and political relationships with other nations.Convenience: In some cases, a country may simply find it more convenient to use the currency of another country rather than trying to maintain its own currency. This can be especially true for smaller countries that may not have the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage their own currency.",1
human_125,"To summarize your starting situation: You want to: Possible paths: No small business Get a job. Invest the 300K in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on which company you work for that could include 401K (Regular or Roth), deductible IRA, Roth IRA. The amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you, how much they match, and the amount of income you earn. For the 401K you will invest from your paycheck, but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the 300K. If you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouse's account. You current income funds any vacations or splurges, because you will not need to put additional funds into your retirement plan. By your late 30's the 300K will now be fully invested in retirement account. Unfortunately you can't touch much of it without paying penalties until you are closer to age 60. Each year before semi-retirement, you will have to invest some of your salary into non-retirement accounts to cushion you between age 40 and age 60. Invest/start a business: Take a chunk of the  300K, and decide that in X years you will use it to start a small business. This chunk of money must be liquid and invested safely so that you can use it when you want to. You also don't want to invest it in investments that have a risk of loss. Take the remaining funds and invest it as described in the no small business section. You will completely convert funds to retirement funds earlier because of a smaller starting amount. Hopefully the small business creates enough income to allow you to continue to fund retirement or semi-retirement. But it might not. Comment regarding 5 year ""rules"": Roth IRA: you have to remain invested in the Roth IRA for 5 years otherwise your withdrawal is penalized. Investing in stocks: If your time horizon is short, then stocks are too volatile. If it drops just before you need the money, it might not recover in time. Final Advice: Get a financial adviser that will lay out a complete plan for a fixed fee. They will discuss investment options, types not particular funds. They will also explain the tax implications of investing in various retirement accounts, and how that will impact your semi-retirement plans. Review the plan every few years as tax laws change.",0

In most of the United States, the impetus for housing is so strong that it's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation, price in this case being interest rates. Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get.

However, there are trade-offs to consider for each option.One benefit of increasing dividends is that it provides a regular source of income for shareholders. This can be particularly appealing for investors who rely on the dividends for their income or for those who are looking for a steady stream of returns from their investments. However, increasing dividends can also put pressure on a company's cash flow, as it requires the company to pay out a portion of its profits on a regular basis.On the other hand, instituting a share buyback allows a company to buy back its own shares from the market, which can help to increase the value of the remaining shares by reducing the total number of outstanding shares. This can be a good option for a company that has a strong balance sheet and is looking to return excess cash to shareholders. However, share buybacks can also be seen as a sign that the company doesn't have any good investment opportunities or that management is not confident in the company's future growth prospects.Ultimately, the decision of whether to increase dividends or institute a share buyback will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial situation, its long-term growth prospects, and the preferences of its shareholders.",1

The Form 1042-S will report income that is subject to US withholding tax, such as salary, wages, or other compensation, as well as certain types of investment income, such as dividends or capital gains.To report the income on your Canadian tax return, you will need to complete the appropriate sections of the tax return form. For example, if the income reported on the Form 1042-S is salary or wages, you will need to report it on the ""employment income"" line of your tax return. If the income is from dividends or capital gains, you will need to report it on the appropriate lines for those types of income.If you cashed in stock options and realized a capital gain, you will need to report the gain on your tax return. In Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than regular income, so you may be eligible for a reduced tax rate on your gain. To report the gain, you will need to complete the ""capital gains (or losses)"" section of your tax return.

It is not money that is debited as cash from the accounting ledger of your trading account, but is held by your broker to cover any potential losses that may arise when you finally settle you position.

Note that some portions of these forms are in different color (1099-MISC copy A). This is important, and using incorrect color will affect the IRS OCR mechanisms.

As such, using professional software and special forms is a cost of doing your business, and not a tax as it would be had it been mandatory to everyone. Mistakes in individual forms due to OCR failure or something else will be noticed by the taxpayers (less/more refund, etc) or through the internal matching and cross-check.

human_164,"You pointed out that HFT does not create ipods are mine minerals.  Neither does human trading. HFT is a proxy for human trading.  Although the computer is executing trades automatically based on an algorithm, it is still using money from a human being's account so the trading is still being done with someone's money. Fast execution of trades is desirable in exchanges.  Imagine two exchanges:  One only executes trades once a month, the other executes trades once a week.  Which exchange would be more desirable?  The exchange that trades once a week.  Why?  Because if I'm holding a stock that I would like to sell, I want to sell it now - not a month from now.  Same reason for buying.  This concept works all the way down to seconds and fractions of seconds. The issue with HFT, however, is there are cases where the market goes against the HFT algorithm and the algorithm continues to execute trades driving prices up or down by large amounts in the matter of minutes or even seconds. The exchange frequently cancels these trades which only encourages more aggressive HFT trading since HFT traders can have their losses cancelled.  This is a privilege that LFTs (low frequency traders) do not receive.  This is a valid criticism of HFTs. A short list of such cancelled trades: 8/26/2010: Nasdaq cancels trades of CORE stock 10/4/2010: Nasdaq cancels trades of CENX stock 10/15/2010: NYSE cancels trades of PAY stock 10/18/2010: NYSE cancels $500 million worth of SPY trades 5/18/2011: NYSE cancels 15,900 trades of BEE.PR.C 6/21/2011: Nasdaq cancels CNTY trades 12/2/2011: London Metals Exchange cancel trades of copper",0

HFT has been a controversial topic, with some arguing that it provides liquidity and other efficiencies to financial markets, while others claim that it can lead to market manipulation and instability.One argument in favor of HFT is that it helps to increase liquidity in financial markets by providing a source of demand and supply for securities. HFT firms may also provide price discovery services, helping to identify the fair value of securities and contributing to price efficiency. Additionally, HFT can help to reduce the cost of trading for investors by providing competition among market makers and contributing to tighter spreads between bid and ask prices.However, some critics argue that HFT can contribute to market instability and unfairness. For example, HFT firms may be able to execute trades faster than other traders, giving them an advantage in certain market conditions. There have also been concerns about the potential for HFT firms to engage in manipulative or predatory practices, such as placing and then quickly canceling orders in order to create the appearance of market activity or to manipulate prices.Overall, the economic value of HFT is a matter of debate.

Given the issue of ""allowed by not required"" the flexibility is greater once the account has been transferred to an IRA. With few exceptions, there's little reason to leave the account with the 401(k) after leaving that company.  (Note - I understand the original question as worded can mean the account holder passes while still working for the company. In that case, this wouldn't be an option.)",0
human_181,Text Book values drop rather rapidly and fluctuate quite a bit based on when you are selling (January and August-September when semesters generally start) them. I generally sell my old text books on Amazon for 10-15% less than the peak price over the last 6 months or a year if that much data is available (I use camelcamelcamel.com to get historical data). They generally sell pretty quick so I would say it is a fair price.,0

human_183,"Suppose you're writing a put with a strike price of 80. Say the share's(underlying asset) price goes down to 70. So the holder of the put will exercise the option. Ie he has a 'right to sell' a share worth 70 for rs 80. Whereas a put option writer has an 'obligation to buy' at rs 80 a share trading at rs 70. Always think from the perspective of the holder. If the holder exercises the option, the writer will suffer a loss. Maximum loss he suffers will be the break even FSP, which is Strike price reduced by the premium paid.. If he doesn't exercise the option the writer will make a profit, which can maximum be the put premium received.",0

In your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices. As FX is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other, so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention I listed above.",0
human_185,"Gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways; (1) as a means and (2) as an end.  Means takes the shape of currency. In this form, we value gold in the same way we value the dollar, it allows us to purchase things we want. As a medium of exchange, gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange. For example, I would be valuing one ingot of gold to be worth a dog if I traded a dog for one ingot of gold. The value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction. Gold as an end is valued for its own sake. A good example of this is a jeweler who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic property(s) gold possesses. This is closer to the ""true value"" of gold than using it as a means, but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor. ""You know what I could use right now, a block of gold."" - said no one ever.  But even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake, this is usually done because gold provides a function. For example, if people no longer want to ware jewelry, then a jeweler will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends. To sum up, gold has a perceived value for most people and an ""intrinsic value"" to a select few (for the time being).",0
human_186,"There are a few reasons, dependent on the location of the company.  The first, as you mentioned is that it means that the employee is invested in the companies success - in theory this should motivate the employee to work hard in order to increase the value of their holdings. Sometimes these have a vestment period which requires that they hold the stock for a certain amount of time before they are able to sell, and that they continue working at the company for a certain amount of time. The second, is that unlike cash, providing stocks doesn't come out of the companies liquid cash. While it is still an expense and does devalue the shares of other shareholders, it doesn't effect the daily working capital which is important to maintain to ensure business continuity. And the third, and this is for the employee, is tax reasons. In particular for substantial amounts. Of course this is dependent on jurisdiction but you can often achieve lower tax rates on receiving shares vs a cash equivalent sum, as you can draw out the money over time lowering your tax obligation each year, or other methods which aren't possible to look into now. Hope this helps.",0
human_187,"Yes, theoretically you can flip the shares you agreed to buy and make a profit, but you're banking on the market behaving in some very precise and potentially unlikely ways.  In practice it's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it's currently listed for, and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference.  Yes, the price could drop to $28, but it could just as easily drop to $27.73 (or further) and now you're hurting, before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved. Another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet; the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect, the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not.  One of you has to lose.  And unless you've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser, long term, is quite likely to be you. Now that said, it is possible (particularly when selling puts) to create win-win scenarios for yourself, where you're betting one direction, but you'd be perfectly happy with the alternative(s).   Here's an example.  Suppose, unrelated to the option chain, you've come to the conclusion that you'd be happy paying $28 for BBY.  It's currently (June 2011) at ~$31, so you can't buy it on the open market for a price you'd be happy with.  But you could sell a $28 put, promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it (presumably, because the price is now below $28). Either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates, or the option is executed, and you receive 100 shares of BBY at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay.  Even if the list price is now lower, long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $28.  Conceptually, this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself. Of course, you could be wrong in your estimate (too low, and you now have a position that might not become profitable; too high, and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value), but that is not unique to options - if you're bad at estimating value (which is not to be confused with predicting price movement) you're doomed just about whatever you do.",0
human_188,"You are thinking about this very well.  With option one, you need to think about the 5 D's in the contract.  What happens when one partner becomes disinterested, divorced (break up), does drugs (something illegal), dies or does not agree with decisions. One complication if you buy jointly, and decide to break up/move, on will the other partner be able to refinance?  If not the leaving person will probably not be able to finance a new home as the banks are rarely willing to assume multiple mortgage risks for one person.  (High income/large down payment not with standing.) I prefer the one person rents option to option one.  The trouble with that is that it sounds like you are in better position to be the owner, and she has a higher emotional need to own.

human_191,"If you sell through an intermediate who sets up the shop for you, odds are they collect and pay the sales tax for you. My experience is with publishing books through Amazon, where they definitely handle this for you. If you can find a retailer that will handle the tax implications, that might be a good reason to use them.  It looks like Etsy uses a different model where you yourself are responsible for the sales tax, which requires you to register with your state (looks like this is the information for New York) and pay the taxes yourself on a regular basis; see this link for a simple guide. If you're doing this, you'll need to keep track of how much tax you owe from your sales each month, quarter, or year (depending on the state laws).  You can usually be a sole proprietor, which is the easiest business structure to set up; if you want to limit your legal liability, or work with a partner, you may want to look into other forms of business structure, but for most craftspeople a sole proprietorship is fine to start out with.  If you do a sole proprietorship, you can probably file the income on a 1040 Schedule C when you do your personal taxes each year.",0

Because for a stock that has a last traded priced of $5 or $6 and volume traded over $4M (i.e. it seems to be quite liquid), it is hardly likely that the difference from bid to ask would be as large as $1 (maybe for a stock that has volume of 4 to 5 thousand, but not for one having volume of 4 to 5 million).

human_195,"Yes.  The investment world is extremely fast-paced and competitive. There are loads of professional traders with supercomputers working day in and day out to make smarter, faster trade decisions than you. If you try to compete with them, there’s a better than fair chance you’ll lose precious time and money, which kind of defeats the purpose. A good wealth manager: In short, they can save you time and money and help you take the most advantage of your current savings. Or, you can think about it in terms of cost. Most wealth managers charge an annual fee (as a % of the amount invested) for their services. This fee can range anywhere from close to zero, to 0.75% depending upon how sophisticated the strategy is that the money will be invested in, and what kind of additional services they have to offer. Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio? Large successful funds like Renaissance Technologies and Citadel can charge 3% in addition to 30% of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market.

human_200,"Here are some important things to think about.  Alan and Denise Fields discuss them in more detail in Your New House. Permanent work.  Where do you want to live?  Are there suitable jobs nearby?  How much do they pay? Emergency fund.  Banks care that you have ""reserves"" (and/or an unsecured line of credit) in case you have a run of bad luck.  This also helps with float the large expenses when closing a loan. Personal line of credit. Who are you building for?  If you are not married, then you should consider whether building a home makes that easier, or harder.  If you hope to have kids, you should consider whether your home will make it easier to have kids, or harder.  If you are married (or seriously considering it), make sure that your spouse helps with the shopping, and is in agreement on the priorities and choices.  If you are not married, then what will you do if/when you get married?  Will you sell?  expand?  build another house on the same lot?  rent the home out? Total budget.  How much can the lot, utilities, permits, taxes, financing charges, building costs, and contingency allowance come to?  Talk with a banker about how much you can afford.  Talk with a build-on-your-lot builder about how much house you can get for that budget.  Consider a new mobile or manufactured home.  But if you do choose one, ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow, and how it affects your rates and terms.  Talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be. Finished lot budget. How much can you budget for the lot, utilities, permits required to get zoning approval, fees, interest, and taxes before you start construction? Down payment.  It sounds like you have a plan for this. Loan underwriting.  Talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are.  Ask about the ""front-end"" and ""back-end"" Debt-To-Income ratios.  In Oregon, I recommend Washington Federal for lot loans and construction loans.  They keep all of their loans, and service the loans themselves.  They use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction.  Their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low, but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area.  (I know two banks with lots of Oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40% of the finished, heated area of some to-be-built homes.)  Avoid any institution (including USAA and NavyFed) that outsources their lending to PHH. Lot loan.  In Oregon, Washington Federal offers lot loans with 30% down payments, 20-year amortization, and one point, on approved credit.  The interest rate can be a fixed rate, but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house.  If you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years, Washington Federal also offers short-term lot loans.  Ask about the costs of appraisals, points, and recording fees. Rent.  How much will it cost to rent a place to live, between when you move back to Oregon, and when your new home is ready to move into? Commute.  How much time will it take to get from your new home to work?  How much will it cost?  (E.g., car ownership, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, taxes, fuel?  If public transportation is an option, how much will it cost?) Lot availability.  How many are there to choose from?  Can you talk a farmer into selling off a chunk of land?  Can you homestead government land?  How much does a lot cost?  Is it worth getting a double lot (or an extra large lot)? Utilities. Do you want to live off the grid?  Are you willing to make the choices needed to do that?  (E.g., well, generator, septic system, satellite TV and telephony, fuel storage)  If not, how much will it cost to connect to such systems?  (For practical purposes, subtract twice the value of these installation costs from the cost of a finished lot, when comparing lot deals.) Easements. These provide access to your property, access for others through your property, and affect your rights.  Utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need.  Until you sign on the dotted line, you can negotiate them down to just what they need.  Talk to a good real estate attorney. Zoning. How much will you be allowed to build?  (In terms of home square footage, garage square footage, roof area, and impermeable surfaces.)  How can the home be used?  (As a business, as a farm, how many unrelated people can live there, etc.)  What setbacks are required?  How tall can the building(s) be?  Are there setbacks from streams, swamps, ponds, wetlands, or steep slopes? Choosing a builder.  For construction loans, banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon, in a timely fashion.  If you want to build your own house, talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder. Plansets and permits.  The construction loan process. If you hire a general contractor, and if you have difficulties with the contractor, you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete.  A good bank will back you up.  Ask about points, appraisal charges, and inspection fees. Insurance during construction.  Some companies have good plans -- if the construction takes 12 months or less.  Some (but not all) auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners' insurance for homes under construction.  Choose your auto insurance company accordingly. Property taxes. Don't forget to include them in your post-construction budget. Homeowners' insurance.  Avoid properties that need flood insurance.  Apply a sanity check to flood maps -- some of them are unrealistic.  Strongly consider earthquake insurance.  Don't forget to include these costs in your post-construction budget. Energy costs.  Some jurisdictions require you to calculate how large a heating system you need.  Do not trust their design temperatures -- they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap, especially if you have a heat pump.  (Some heat pumps work at -10°F -- but most lose their effectiveness between 10°F and 25°F.)  You can use these calculations, in combination with the number of ""heating degree days"" and ""cooling degree days"" at your site, to accurately estimate your energy bills.  If you choose a mobile or manufactured home, calculate how much extra its energy bills will be. Home design.  Here are some good sources of ideas: A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander.  Alexander emphasizes building homes and neighborhoods that can grow, and that have niches within niches within niches. The Not-So-Big House, by Sarah Susanka.  This book applies many Alexander's design patterns to medium and large new houses. Before the Architect.  The late Ralph Pressel emphasized the importance of plywood sheathing, flashing, pocket doors, wide hallways, wide stairways, attic trusses, and open-truss or I-joist floor systems.  Lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too.  (It is possible to have too much detail in a house plan, and too much room in a house.  For examples, see any of his plans.) Tim Garrison, ""the builder's engineer"".  Since Oregon is in earthquake country -- and the building codes do not fully reflect that risk -- emphasize that you want a building that would meet San Jose, California's earthquake code.",0
